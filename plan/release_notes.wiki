Allow simple methods to be registered using the ``catch`` method in the Factory
class.

The Factory class lets a miros user build state machines within a class.  Previous
to this release only static methods could be registered to signals during the
state construction process.

* static methods are still permitted as catch handler inputs (backwards
  compatible)
* standard methods are now also permitted as catch handlers too.
