Added a ThreadSafeAttributes class which when inherited from will provide new
class level syntax for building thread safe attributes.  At the class level you
would write "_attributes = ['attr1', 'attr2', 'attr3']" to produce the thread
safe attributes, "attr1", "attr2" and "attr3".  (Under the hood these attributes
are actually properties of a small deque ring buffer of size 1.)  To see more
about this feature reference the recipes section of the miros project at tag
v4.1.3 or later.
