  *What defines Success?:* ([[subgoals.Multichart_race_pattern|subgoals]])
    Provide a multichart race pattern within an example that would make sense to
    a teenager.

  *What is the problem?*
    The pattern is simple, making it work within an example is harder.  I need
    to find a problem that the reader can relate to, then solve the problem with
    the pattern.  Also, we need to show how to demonstrate that it is working.
    
    Multichart problems describe other concerns like statocals, the avoidance of
    race conditions, etc.

  *Idea/Hypotheses for multichart race pattern: >=5*
  * [ ] Relate the race pattern to battery charging
  * [ ] Investigate how to charge a float battery, bulk versus absorption
  * [ ] Create an example doc, where you lay out the specifications 
  * [ ] In your example documentation, lay out the problem in clear writing with
        clear diagram.
  * [ ] Using the specification, design a statechart
  * [ ] Merge the example back into the patterns section (maybe use the include
        feature)
