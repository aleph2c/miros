*Instructions for Releasing Miros*

= Observe =
  *What defines Success?*

    * Follow the github release process
    * Decent release notes
    * pip upgrade successful

  *What is the problem?*

    * I release so infrequently I can't remember how to do everything.
    * I do not entirely understand the setup.py/pip infrastructure and their
      documents are mostly incomprehensible.

  *Questions regarding your release process:*

    Has the pip infrastructure changed?
    Are you including too much in the pip package?
    After you released, can you upgrade miros to its latest number?

  *Assumptions:*
    
    twine still works

= Decide =
  *Idea/Hypotheses for Release of 4.1.0: >=5*
  * [X] Double check that your setup.py file is excluding all garbage (anything
        not excluded will be put on a user's computer after a 'pip install miros')
  * [X] Re-run all tests
  * [X] Uprev release number in setup.py file
  * [X] Write your release notes
  * [X] Commit and push changes to github
  * [ ] In the github release page, place your release notes, tag using the release number
        in setup.py file ex. v5.1.2
  * [ ] Open cmd window
  * [ ] Navigate to miros project
  * [ ] > python setup.py sdist
  * [ ] > twine upload dist/*
  * [ ] create a new directory, and venv
  * [ ] turn off security so pip will work (and you won't scare yourself)
  * [ ] pip install miros and confirm it is getting the new release
  * [ ] turn on security
