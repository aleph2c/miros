= Decide =
  *Idea/Hypotheses for Release of 4.1.0: >=5*
  * [ ] Double check that your setup.py file is excluding all garbage (anything
        not excluded will be put on a user's computer after a 'pip install miros')
  * [ ] Re-run all tests
  * [ ] Change release name in setup.py file
  * [ ] Write your release notes
  * [ ] Commit and push changes to github
  * [ ] In the github release page, place your release notes
  * [ ] Open cmd window
  * [ ] Navigate to miros project
  * [ ] > python setup.py sdist
  * [ ] > twine upload dist/*
  * [ ] create a new directory, and venv
  * [ ] pip install miros and confirm it is getting the new release
