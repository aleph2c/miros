*Miros Development Plan*

= Observe =
  *What defines Success?*
  
  * Useful documentation that describes how to use the library and how to design
    with pictures
  * A set of presentations
  * Show how to build it into systemd (maybe miros-rabbitmq)
  * Show how create a random number (miros-random)

  *What are the problems?*
  
  * The testing documentation is under developed
  * Zero to One needs to be re-written after Jessica (a beginner) worked through
    and critiqued the work
  * The picture and dynamics need to be understood (maybe more hack to learn)
  * The CCS is broken (out of the box from casper)

  *Evidence that contradicts Assumptions:*
