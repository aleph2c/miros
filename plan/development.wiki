        * a way to turning XML back into a Factory (data-to-code add to
          patterns)
        * a way to inject an HSM within another HSM (add to patterns)
        * turn XML into SVG XML (code-to-data-to-diagram)

    Marketing:
    
      Consider changing the package name to glial, 
      Describe how to use statecharts as a thing between other things, how to
      pull designs out of the dark.
