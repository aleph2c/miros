    What recently changed?

  *Assumptions:*

= Decide =
  *Idea/Hypotheses for Release of 4.1.0: >=5*
  * [ ] Remove doc/docs/test/experiment/examples/ven in setup.py file
  * [ ] Re-run all tests
  * [ ] Change release name in setup.py file
  * [ ] 
  * [ ] 
  *Chosen Idea/Hypothesis*
  * removed unnecessary files from pip package (doc/test...)
  * removed code which hides exceptions within your statechart (this might
    unmask bugs in your design)
  * changed how miros stops active objects.
    * a call to the ActiveObject stop method will not stop the active fabric
    * a call to the ActiveObject stop method will kill all slave threads posting
      events into that ActiveObject.
    * After the stop method is called on an ActiveObject, the ActiveFabric will
      not post events into that ActiveObject's input queue, since it won't exist
      anymore.
