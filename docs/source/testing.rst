  "Why is it that you guys are so conservative in your views, in the face of
  the almost complete lack of understanding of what is going on in your field?"
  I asked.

  The answer was as simple as it was surprising.

  "If we [cosmologists] don't accept some common picture of the universe,
  however unsupported by the facts, there would be nothing to bind us together
  as a scientific community.  Since it is unlikely that any picture that we use
  will be falsified in our lifetime, one theory is as good as any other."

  The explanation was social, not scientific.

  You always start with a fantasy. Part of the fantasy technique is to
  visualize something as perfect. Then with the experiments you work back from
  the fantasy to reality, hacking away at the components.
