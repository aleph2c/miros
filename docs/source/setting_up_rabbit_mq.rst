Setting Up RabbitMQ
====================
Before we setup RabbitMQ, I should tell you what it is.  It's a library written
on top of the Erlang programming language which allows you to send messages
across the Internet, or just to different processes running on your machine.

Even though it is written in Erlang, RabbitMQ supports many different
programming languages, including Python.  It does this with the ``pika``
library.

Bernhard Wenzel provides an excellent introduction to RabbitMQ here:

  </div>

I found the installation documentation on the RabbitMQ website to be mostly
illegible to me as a new user, so I wrote this guide to save you the pain which
I went through.

.. note::

  Most of the documentation on the RabbitMq website is illegible (except their
  tutorials section).  There are a lot of words written but think of their
  documents as a collection of open secrets; they are a consulting company after
  all. (their docs remind me of the Noam Chomsky bot that can write you pages
  and pages of gibberish).

.. _setting_up_rabbit_mq-installing-on-linux-with-ansible:

Installing On Linux with Ansible
--------------------------------
To get your RabbitMQ server working over a network with Python requires at least
ten steps, so I have automated them using Ansible.

If you haven't seen Ansible before, it is a tool for automatically deploying
software onto Linux systems.  It makes sense to use Ansible for two different
reasons; it turns your program installation into source code that you can keep
under revision control, and it is scalable; with minimal effort, you can deploy
things onto multiple machines.

To install Ansible:

.. code-block:: shell

  sudo apt-get install ansible

Now if you don't know already, figure out what your hostname is, by typing:

.. code-block:: shell

  hostname

When I type this on the raspberry pi that I tested this procedure with, I see its
hostname is ``scotty``.  In the following examples replace ``scotty`` with your
hostname.

Now you will need to change the host files for Ansible.

.. code-block:: shell

  sudo pico /etc/ansible/hosts

Now add the following:

::

  [scotty]
  127.0.0.1

Save (write-out) and exit the file.  What I have done is to link my hostname,
``scotty`` to my IP address.  127.0.0.1 is always the IP of your local machine.
By writing this into the ``/etc/ansible/hosts`` file I am telling Ansible that I
want to do a deployment to *this* machine when I reference ``scotty`` in the
Ansible file (which we will talk about shortly).

.. note::

  If you want to have Ansible deploy RabbitMQ to other IP addresses, you can add
  them below the 127.0.0.1 address in the ``/etc/ansible/hosts`` file.  In this
  way you can have rabbitMq install everywhere you need it, all at once.

Ansible does its deployments using ssh.  So to use Ansible we have to setup ssh
for our computer.

To do this, we generate a public and private key, then concatenate our public
key into our ``authorized_keys``.  If you don't have a ``id_rsa`` or a
``id_rsa.pub`` in your ``~/.ssh/`` directory, then you need to make them.  To do
this:

.. code-block:: shell

  mkdir ~/.ssh
  cd ~/.ssh
  sudo ssh-keygen

When you see an option to enter a passphrase, just hit enter.

Now that you have a public and private key, you want to concatenate your
``authorized_keys`` file with your public key:

.. code-block:: shell

  sudo cat '~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub' >> '~/.ssh/authorized_keys'

.. note::

  If you have included other IP addresses in your ansible host file, you will
  need to place your public key onto these servers as well, to do this:

  .. code-block:: shell

    cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | \
    ssh user@hostname 'cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys'

To test that this works, I type the following and confirm that I can login
using ssh:

.. code-block:: shell

  ssh $USER@scotty

If this command succeeds, you will log into another version of your shell.

To exit this connection, just type ``exit``.

Now that I can login to this computer using ssh, Ansible can perform automatic
deployments for me.

Ansible uses a set of :term:`yml<YAML>` files to hold instructions on how to deploy
something.  These files are pretty straightforward to read and are mostly self
documenting.

Since I only want to deploy RabbitMQ, I have written just one Ansible
:term:`yml<YAML>` file to do this job.  But a RabbitMQ server is configured
with two different configuration files, one that holds the environment
variables and the other that is an Erlang data structure.  To keep
configurations :term:`DRY<DRY>`, Ansible allows you to define
:term:`jinja2<JINJA2>` template files (j2 extension) to be filled in
with the variables defined in your deployment :term:`yml<YAML>` file.

When your run Ansible, it will reference your template files, change the parts
that you have marked up with :term:`jinja2 syntax<JINJA2>` with the variables
defined in your :term:`yml<YAML>` file, then place these newly constructed
configuration files in the directory where they need to be with the correct
permissions.

So to deploy a networkable RabbitMQ setup, I have created three files which will
be used by Ansible:

====================================== =====================
Purpose                                File Name and Link
====================================== =====================
The deployment yml script              rabbit_install.yml_
The rabbitmq environment configuration rabbit-env.conf.j2_
The rabbitmq configuration             rabbitmq.config.j2_
====================================== =====================

Copy the above files into a directory on your Linux machine.

The only thing you should change is the ``hosts`` (which is set to scotty), the
``rabbit_name`` (bob), ``rabbit_password`` (dobbs) and the ``guest_password``
(rabbit123) to whatever you want.  These variables are found in the
rabbit_install.yml_ file.

Now to setup your RabbitMQ server, type:

.. code-block:: shell

  ansible-playbook -K rabbit_install.yml

This command will prompt you for your ``sudo`` password, enter it and the
rabbitmq server should be setup.

To see if your server is running, you can open the management software that
comes with it via their web app, by typing ``localhost:15672`` and log in with your
user name and password, if you didn't change this in the
rabbit_install.yml_ file, your user name will be ``bob`` and the password will
be ``dobbs``:

    :class: scale-to-fit

If you have come this far you have a working RabbitMQ message broker running on
your Linux system.

------------------------------------------------------------

Ok, now what?

To learn how to use it with Python, there is a great set of tutorials provided
on the `RabbitMQ site <https://www.rabbitmq.com/getstarted.html/>`_.

The only problem with these tutorials is that they do not show you how to
network RabbitMQ.  I wrestled with their example code for a while and got them
working across my network.

If you want to code by example, I recommend that you work through their
tutorials, then use my code to see how to make it work across your own network:

=================  ======================= ===================================

.. note::
  On security.  This configuration is NOT secure at all.

  The rabbitmq server is not secure.  I have made it possible to transmit
  messages across the network using the default user name, guest.  Also, the
  messages are not encrypted.
