<dt id="term-orthogonal-region">Orthogonal Region</dt><dd><p>A concept taken from the original Harel paper.  To understand what is meant
by an orthogonal region imagine two statecharts sitting beside one
another with a bunch of arrows between them. Loosely speaking if your to
draw a circle around these two statecharts and their arrows, you would be
describing two orthogonal regions. The word ‘orthogonal’ comes from
geometry where it describes a right angle. In the context of physics
‘orthogonal’ builds on this right angle idea and it adds the meaning that
two things do not effect each other that much.</p>
<p>The problem with orthogonal regions is one of search expense. If you are
sitting deep within one region and your statechart receives and event which
should take it deep within the other region, it must first search the chart
structure to find where it needs to go. The underlying framework within the
library does this work before it actually starts the exit and entry processing.</p>
<p>Given that you might be in the inner state of one of your orthogonal regions,
and you will need to search all the way out of this statechart and reach into
another; you are wasting cycles and adding a lot of computational complexity to
your design. This search is handled by the miros package, but your code will
run a lot slower than it needs to.</p>
<p>If you find yourself doing this, consider refacting your code using the
<span class="xref std std-ref">reminder pattern</span>.</p>

<dt id="term-run-to-completion">Run To Completion</dt><dd><p>A run to completion process begins when a statechart receives an event.
It searches its local graph and makes a determination if it needs to
respond, if so it will transition from the local state to the target
state while adhering to the <a class="reference internal" href="#term-harel-formalism"><span class="xref std std-term">Harel Formalism</span></a>,
then it will run the INIT_SIGNAL within that target state.  If that state
initiations itself by transitioning to another state, the event processor
will run that transition with the <a class="reference internal" href="#term-harel-formalism"><span class="xref std std-term">Harel Formalism</span></a>.  This will continue until the <a class="reference internal" href="#term-statechart"><span class="xref std std-term">statechart</span></a>
has nothing left to do at which point it is finished its
run-to-completion processing.  The active objects can not be pre-empted
with new events while they are in the throes of running through a RTC

not be considered by the event processor until its RTC step is
completed.</p>

events into pools of commmon meaning that can be used by your state
