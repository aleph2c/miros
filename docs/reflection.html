<span id="reflection-thoughts-on-reflection"></span><h2>Thoughts On Reflection<a class="headerlink" href="#thoughts-on-reflection" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The <cite>miros</cite> framework has several different mechanisms to view how your design
behaves.  This is extremely important, since with the compacting of complexity
into behavioral maps it is very easy to lose track of what your system actually
does.  In fact, it is inevitable that for any moderately ambitious design, you
will not be able to track the entirety of its behavior in your head.  With any
addition of state or event management there is an exponential increase in the
number of possible stories your chart can tell.  This is the power and the
curse of a statechart.</p>
<p>The state of your chart might change as it responds to an event, so you might
want to <a class="reference internal" href="#reflection-what-state-am-i-in"><span class="std std-ref">reflect upon the current state</span></a>.</p>
<p>You might want to view <a class="reference internal" href="#reflection-a-high-level-description-of-the-behavior"><span class="std std-ref">what events caused what state transitions from a
high level</span></a>.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="#reflection-an-extremely-detailed-view"><span class="std std-ref">You may need to view the state dynamics in fine detail.</span></a>.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="#reflection-live-output-from-your-chart"><span class="std std-ref">If you have a number of charts running in parallel, you may want to see how
they interact in a live manner.</span></a></p>
<p>The tools needed to view these dynamics are embedded into the <cite>miros</cite> framework.</p>
<p>Another issue that is faced is how to explain your design to someone else.  A
statechart diagram is not helpful when you are talking to a customer or someone
within your team who is not versed in Harel formalism.  For this reason, it is
good to talk about a specific behavior, not all of the behaviors at once.  A
statechart diagram might make sense to you but it can psychologically shutdown
a teammate.  <cite>miros</cite> <span class="xref std std-ref">provides a way to translate how your chart responds
to a particular event into a different type of diagram, a sequence
diagram</span>.  Anyone can understand a
sequence diagram.  By referencing something that is easy to understand you can
reduce the transaction costs in your organization; everyone should be able to
participate in the conversation.</p>
<p>With the smallest adjustment of a statechart, all of your sequence diagrams can
become moot.  For this reason the sequence diagrams can be generated
programatically from the trace output.  This means that you don’t have to waste
expensive engineering time on documentation that will be thrown away as you
build out your system.  This is also important because your engineers won’t
become reluctant to change a design to avoid hours and hours of grinding work.</p>
<p>I would recommend that if you use statecharts, you avoid using non-text based
documentation systems.  If you use Word to make pretty diagrams, the steps to
manually change your documents will amplify cost through your organization.
Whereas if you use markdown, LaTeX, HTML, anything that can quickly be
constructed without a lot of user intervention, it is easy and cheap to change
your design descriptions.  If you want to buy a Microsoft product, buy Visio,
since you can make beautiful diagrams with links.  It makes sense to put a lot
of time and attention into the map.  To save money, you can use <a href="#id3"><span class="problematic" id="id4">`umlet`_</span></a>
instead.</p>
<p>Suppose you are a documentation genius.  This doesn’t mean that anyone wants to
read your work.  With the <cite>miros</cite> reflection features an engineer can run an
experiment to see how the system actually behaves, rather than digging into
dreary specifications.  The chart will quickly become the specification, this
is the point of Harel formalism.  The specification documents can be thought of
as temporary work orders that adjust the global specification, the chart
itself.</p>
<p>As your system gets bigger and more complicated, it is very important to lock
it down with tests.  But the more specific the test, the more tightly coupled
it is to your design.  Any change will break it.  To fix things an engineer
could isolate the test, reflect upon the behavior, determine if it is correct
by carefully thinking about it, then overwrite the test with a copy of the
reflection.  <a class="reference internal" href="#reflection-how-to-test-using-reflection"><span class="std std-ref">It has to be very easy and cheap to isolate and update your tests</span></a>,
otherwise your organization will lose this discipline and you will lose control
of your design.</p>

<h2>A High Level Description of The Behavior<a class="headerlink" href="#a-high-level-description-of-the-behavior" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If you would like to see what your active object was doing from a <strong>very high
level</strong>, you can look at it’s <cite>trace</cite> instrumentation.  The trace will only
create a log item if a state transition has occurred. Each line in the <cite>trace</cite>
will contain:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>A datetime stamp between square brackets</li>
<li>The active object name, between square brackets</li>
<li>The event that caused the transition, its signal number and its payload</li>
<li>The starting state</li>
<li>The ending state</li>
</ol>
<p>If you haven’t named your active object, a unique identifier is given to it,
and the first 5 characters of this unique identifier will be used in the trace.
The reason that an identifier is given to it is so that the trace outputs, from
multiple active objects, can be distinguished from one another.</p>
<p>Suppose you have built the tazor active object described in the <span class="xref std std-ref">second
example</span>. Suppose you named this active object <cite>tazor</cite>:
To see the trace you would type:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">tazor</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">trace</span><span class="p">()</span>

might have occurred, reference <a class="reference internal" href="postingexample.html#examples-simple-posting-example"><span class="std std-ref">the example from which it

<p>The spy log is a ring buffer that contains 500 spots.  This is so your system
can run forever without using an infinite amount of memory.  Once the internal
spy log has run out of room, it will shift out the old data and write the new
data at the tail end of its log.</p>

<p>If you would like to sketch out the high level behavior of your statechart using
a trace output as the target for a regression test, you would:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Run your program and print your trace to the output.</li>

<li>Run this trace target and the future output of the statechart trace through

timestamp information.</li>
<li>Compare your target with the results.</li>
</ol>
<p>This should become clear with an example.</p>
<p>Consider a statechart that outputted the following at the point when you were
working on it.</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">2017</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">11</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mo">05</span> <span class="mi">21</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="mi">31</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="mf">56.098526</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">tazor</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="n">e</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="n">start_at</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="n">top</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="n">arming</span>

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>You might have gotten this output with the following code:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">tazor</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">trace</span><span class="p">())</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>It does a decent job describing what we want, but it has timestamps.  With the
<cite>stripped</cite> context manager we can turn the above into something that would look
like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">tazor</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="n">e</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="n">start_at</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="n">top</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="n">arming</span>
<span class="p">[</span><span class="n">tazor</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="n">e</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="n">BATTERY_CHARGE</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="n">arming</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="n">armed</span>
<span class="p">[</span><span class="n">tazor</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="n">e</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="n">BATTERY_CHARGE</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="n">armed</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="n">armed</span>

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>That is something that shouldn’t change over time, it looks like something we
could use as a test specification.  The only problem is that when we run the
code in the future and generate a new trace we get a trace with a pre-pended
date timestamp.  We can get around this issue like this:</p>

<p>On line <strong>1</strong> we import the stripped context manager.</p>
<p>On lines <strong>3-7</strong> we define the target as just being the trace that we copied
when we were first designing our statechart.</p>
<p>On line <strong>9</strong>, we map this target to the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">stripped_target</span></code> which contains the
same string with the date timestamps removed.</p>
<p>On line <strong>10</strong>, we use the same stripped context manager to strip our tazor active
object’s trace output of it’s date timestamp information and place the result
into the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">stripped_trace_result</span></code> variable.</p>
<p>Lines <strong>12-13</strong> are for testing each line of our output against our target.</p>
<p>If our design changes, it is easy to update the test, we just copy the new
trace of of new design into the target string and everything should be peachy.</p>

<p>On line <strong>1</strong> we have a commented pretty print command ready to go for when we
need to rebuild our test specification.  When the test fails in the future,
which it will because this is a tightly coupled test, we will uncomment lines
<strong>1-2</strong> then re-run the test.</p>
<p>This will drop us into a debugging session just after our next spy output has
been printed to the screen.  At this point we would carefully determine if it
actually describes the new behavior we are looking for. If it wasn’t, we would
fix the issue, otherwise we over-write lines <strong>4-16</strong> with this new
specification.</p>
<p>We would re-comment lines <strong>1-2</strong> and re-run our tests.</p>

then use it to generate a sequence diagram, with <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/aleph2c/sequence">sequence</a>.</p>

<p>Then I would manually replace the question marks with numbers, so that

ASCII, I could place it in my code comments.</p>

<p>You can gang two tazors together to act as one tazor.  The first arming event
in your tazor network will also arm all of the other tazors, consider the
diagram above to see this interaction.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Tazor labeled ‘Unit 1’ turns on in the <cite>arming</cite> state.</li>
<li>Tazor labeled ‘Unit 2’ turns on in the <cite>arming</cite> state.</li>
<li>Unit 1 begins a battery charge (BC) which will send a broadcast message to
all other tazors in the network.</li>
<li>Unit 2 detects another tazor is beginning a battery charge, so it too begins
it’s battery charge (OTHER)</li>
</ol>
<p>…. and so on</p>
<p>If I changed the above design, it would be simple to adjust these diagrams and
their description.  Sequence diagrams are great for explaining small things,
but they do break the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">DRY</a> principle.  You are effectively replicating your
data by having these descriptions in your documentation.  The source <cite>image</cite> is
your state chart diagram.  Give it a lot of attention, since it is actually
your specification.  The sequence diagrams are little throw away things, that
can be used to assist in telling a very specific story about how your system
behaves.</p>
<p>I’m probably not following the UML standard and I don’t care.  The utility of
the sequence diagram picture is in its simplicity.</p>
<p>I know that you can represent loops and object destructor’s using these
diagrams, but why bother?  It is easier to write a loop in the code than it is
in a picture, so why not copy and paste the code onto the sequence diagram if
you need to explain a loop?</p>
<p>If you would like to create sequence diagrams that are UML compliant, the
<a href="#id5"><span class="problematic" id="id6">`umlet`_</span></a> program supports these features.</p>
