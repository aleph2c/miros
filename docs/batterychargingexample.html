<p>Lead acid batteries are very heavy.  But they are cheaper than lithium ion
batteries and this is why they are used in a lot of off-grid electrical systems.</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="https://www.lowtechmagazine.com/2015/05/sustainability-off-grid-solar-power.html"><img alt="https://krisdedecker.typepad.com/.a/6a00e0099229e8883301bb0820445e970d-pi" class="align-center" src="https://krisdedecker.typepad.com/.a/6a00e0099229e8883301bb0820445e970d-pi" /></a>
<p>A large lead-acid battery is made up of a set of smaller lead-acid batteries
connected together in series.  These smaller batteries are called cells.</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="https://chargetek.com/images/pdfs/equal.pdf"><img alt="_images/cells_in_series.PNG" class="align-center" src="_images/cells_in_series.PNG" /></a>
<p>Each cell contains two terminals, and each terminal is connected to a plate that
reaches down into a bath of sulphuric acid (H2SO4) and water (H2O).  There is a
positive and a negative terminal.  The positive terminal of a cell is made up of
lead dioxide (PbO2) and the negative terminal is made out of lead (Pb).</p>
<p>A battery is a chemical reaction that wants to happen, but can’t until there is
a path for electrons to flow from one material to another.  As a result, there
is a voltage potential expressed across the positive and negative terminals of
the battery.  If an electrical device is connected across these terminals an
electron path is made, the battery can begin its chemical reaction.  As a side
effect the electrical device is powered on.  The flow of current leaves the
positive terminal and enters the negative terminal.  When this happens the
battery is said to discharge.</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="https://circuitglobe.com/lead-acid-battery.html"><img alt="https://circuitglobe.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/lead-acid-cell-112.jpg" class="align-center" src="https://circuitglobe.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/lead-acid-cell-112.jpg" /></a>
<p>Charging of a battery occurs when current is forced to flow in the opposite
direction: current leaves the negative terminal and enters the positive
terminal. This causes the chemical reaction to reverse, sequestering the
electrons back into the various materials of the battery.  You can charge a
battery with a battery charger.</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="https://circuitglobe.com/lead-acid-battery.html"><img alt="https://circuitglobe.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/recharging-of-lead-acid-battery.jpg" class="align-center" src="https://circuitglobe.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/recharging-of-lead-acid-battery.jpg" /></a>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>If you aren’t familiar with the terminology of electricity, imagine a water
tower.  The water is trying to get to the ground, due to gravity,
but it is held in place by the walls of the tower.  This means that there is a
potential for the water to flow, the height of the tower determines how much
energy is stored within it.  The higher the tower, the higher the potential
energy.  Voltage is analogous to height of the held water in the tower.</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTtYw4fJS9o3meW9yv5ZGJ5enzVpyJ0sfw5L45UifmATQERiArD"><img alt="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTtYw4fJS9o3meW9yv5ZGJ5enzVpyJ0sfw5L45UifmATQERiArD" class="align-center" src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTtYw4fJS9o3meW9yv5ZGJ5enzVpyJ0sfw5L45UifmATQERiArD" /></a>
<p>Now imagine connecting a pipe from the tower to the ground, and letting the
water flow through it.  This flow is like current in an electrical system, and
the pipe width would limit that flow, so that would be like an electrical load.</p>
<p>Our battery is like a water tower; if no pipe is connected, current can’t flow.
If a pipe is connected, it can, and the energy of the battery reduces just like
the potential energy of our water tower would reduce as it’s water leaves it
through a pipe.  If you were to push the current back into the pipe, by
connecting a higher water tower, or by just driving the current back up the
tube with a pump, you would cause the potential of the water tower to increase.
We would be charging the tower.</p>
<p class="last">As mentioned before, a battery is made up of stacking cells in series.  Think of
that as a very tall water tower made up of stacked shorter water towers.  You
can increase their potential energy by stacking them this way.</p>
</div>
<p>As a lead acid battery is discharged, a crust of lead sulphate (PbSO4) forms on the
plates.  This crust reduces the surface area of the lead plates exposed to the
acid, reducing its ability to react and drive current.</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="https://stevedmarineconsulting.com/sulfation-too-many-batteries-die-an-unnecessarily-early-death-from-this-phenomenon/"><img alt="https://stevedmarineconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/082504179.jpg" class="align-center" src="https://stevedmarineconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/082504179.jpg" /></a>
<p>There are electrical charging techniques which can remove this lead sulphate
(PbSO4), by reversing the chemical reaction, and even sometimes bubbling the
acid.  These bubbles physically massage away the lead sulphate crystals,
dislodging them from the plate, dropping them into the acid bath where they can
break down, crystallizing their lead atoms back onto the plates.</p>
<p>An electrical charger can control one of two things, it can act to control
current flow or it can control the voltage across the terminals of the
battery.  If it holds the current constant, electrons are pushed back into the
battery, which will cause the voltage of the battery to slowly rise over time.</p>
<p>If the charger holds the voltage at a higher potential than the battery voltage,
current will flow into the battery.  At first it will flow quickly, but over
time the battery’s ability to accept electrons will be limited by the amount of
material within it, causing the current flow to subside.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">Thinking back to the water tower.  If we re-filled our water tower using a
pump to push a constant amount of water, this would be like controlling the
current being pushed into the battery.  If we connected a higher water tower,
and let it passively drain some of its water into the lower tower, this would
be like controlling the voltage of our charger.  Together the two towers
would have the potential energy of the taller tower, so it’s voltage would be
set to this.</p>
</div>
<p>When you hear people talk about the stages of charging of a battery, they are
talking about either a constant current or a constant voltage charging
technique.  In two stage charging, a constant current technique starts the
charging process, then once the battery voltage rises to a high enough level, a
constant voltage technique takes over.  In three stage charging, the third stage
is a constant voltage technique, but held at a lower value than the second
stage.  A forth stage of charging can be applied very infrequently, it’s called
equalization.  It is a constant voltage technique that applies such a high
voltage across the battery terminals, that the acid boils, and explosive
hydrogen is expelled from the batteries (this is why battery rooms need to be
well vented).</p>
<p>There are arbitrary naming conventions that have been applied to these stages of
charging:</p>

<p>A charger is typically called one of these:</p>

<tr class="row-even"><td><em>three stage charger</em></td>
<td>bulk followed by absorption, followed by float</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The <em>equalization</em> stage is so dangerous that it doesn’t happen automatically,
it has to be manually set by the user.</p>
<p>It has been found that when you charge batteries with three stage chargers, the
process of plate sulphation is slower than it would be with a two stage charger.
If such a charger is also equipped with the equalization feature, a knowledgeable
user can keep their battery’s healthy for a long time.</p>
<p>Let’s look at the three stage charging electrical profile:</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="_static/three_stage_charging_all.pdf"><div align="center" class="align-center"><img alt="_images/three_stage_charging_all.svg" src="_images/three_stage_charging_all.svg" /></div>
</a>
<p>That diagram is not going to win any graphic design awards, but it shows you
everything you need to know about building a charger.  We need two control
systems, one that can hold current to a constant level and one that can hold the
voltage to a constant level.  We need to track time, so that we can exit a stage
if the charger has been in it too long.  And we need to be able to set some
parameters based on the kind of battery we are attached too.</p>
<p>The bulk stage is where the battery is charged quickly.  Charging the battery is
what our customer’s care about the most, but battery maintenance is very
important too.</p>
<p>The charger will have a rated current, the more money we put into its hardware,
the higher this current can be.  The problem is if we over-build this, our
charger will be too big for a lot of systems and these customers will buy
someone else’s product because it is cheaper than ours.</p>
<p>A way to solve this problem is to build a charger that can be ganged together
with more versions of itself.  That way we can keep the costs low, and if a
customer needs a lot of current, they can buy as many of our products as they
need and gang them together in parallel.</p>
<p>The added benefit of this approach is that if one of their chargers fails, there
batteries can still be charged by the others in their system.  It offers them
some resilience.  If they felt so inclined, they could actually over-build their
charging system to increase their system’s reliability (think military
contracts).  Batteries are expensive, heavy and dangerous, and chargers are
relatively cheap and easy to work with and install.</p>
<p>Another problem our customers have is with the parameters.  We can’t expect them
to figure out what all of the values and time-outs mean.  They really don’t
care, we need to eat this complexity on their behalf, especially if we are
expecting them to buy a bunch of our products for a single installation.</p>
<p>Often the hardest thing to do on a project is to pack knowledge into a
specification.  The specification should be simple and full of pictures, if it
isn’t nobody will look a it, and nobody will change it to match what the system
actually does.  Engineers talk with pictures, because pictures transmit more
information than writing.  Pictures also illicit conversation.  When you are
talking to technical people they often forget that they know a lot of things you
don’t know, and if you are both pointing and talking about a picture you can
extract this knowledge.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Specification iteration 1:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><span class="new-spec">A charger has two control systems: constant current and constant voltage.</span></li>
<li><span class="new-spec">The bulk stage is a constant current control technique.</span></li>
<li><span class="new-spec">The absorption, float and equalization stages are constant voltage control
techniques.</span></li>
</ul>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="_static/three_stage_charging_chart_1.pdf"><div align="center" class="align-center"><img alt="_images/three_stage_charging_chart_1.svg" src="_images/three_stage_charging_chart_1.svg" /></div>
</a>
<p>I show the diagram to the electrical engineer I’m working with, and he says,
“Yeah, it looks good, but can you make sure the two control systems are
generalizeable?”  What do you mean?  “Well, I want to just give the current
control system a reference current and it will drive the device to output that
current.  The same idea applies to the voltage controller.”  He continues, “A
control system is just some math, you give it a goal called a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">reference</span></code>,
then you give it the value of the thing it is trying to control, call this the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">input</span></code> and the math will drive the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">output</span></code> towards the goal.  We connect
this output value to our hardware and it will behave as expected.  I want to use
the same math to solve the current and voltage control problems, so give me a
reference and give me the input and I’ll make it work.”  You turn to leave and
he says, “Oh, one more thing, I need to tune the two control systems
differently, so make sure I can set some variables <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ki</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">kp</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">kd</span></code>.
That should be good”.</p>
<p>So now we have to start thinking about all of the parameters, each can be
changed for a different battery type.  We change the language on the diagram to
match how our electrical engineer talks about things.</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="_static/three_stage_charging_chart_1.pdf"><div align="center" class="align-center"><img alt="_images/three_stage_charging_parameters.svg" src="_images/three_stage_charging_parameters.svg" /></div>
</a>
<p>After we update the image we show our electrical engineer the new picture.  He
looks at it and asks, “What are these arrows connecting the boxes together?”
You answer, it’s just a way of saying that the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">reference</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">input</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">kp</span></code>,
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ki</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">kd</span></code> values will be in both of the current and voltage control
classes.  It’s just a drawing short hand.   He says, “Ok, it looks good.”</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Specification iteration 2:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A charger has two control systems: constant current and constant voltage.</li>
<li>The bulk stage is a constant current control technique.</li>
<li>The absorption, float and equalization stages are constant voltage control
techniques.</li>
<li><span class="new-spec">The electrical profile of the system will look like this:</span></li>
</ul>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="_static/three_stage_charging_chart_1.pdf"><div align="center" class="align-center"><img alt="_images/three_stage_charging_parameters.svg" src="_images/three_stage_charging_parameters.svg" /></div>
</a>
<ul class="simple">
<li><span class="new-spec">The behavior of the system will look like this:</span></li>
</ul>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="_static/three_stage_charging_chart_1.pdf"><div align="center" class="align-center"><img alt="_images/three_stage_charging_chart_1.svg" src="_images/three_stage_charging_chart_1.svg" /></div>
</a>
<p>We still haven’t solved the parameter issue.  I need to create a data structure
that has the control system information and the battery stuff in one place.  How
about this:</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="_static/three_stage_charging_parameters_2.pdf"><div align="center" class="align-center"><img alt="_images/three_stage_charging_parameters_2.svg" src="_images/three_stage_charging_parameters_2.svg" /></div>
</a>
<p>So we make a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ChargerParameter</span></code> class that “has a” (black diamond arrow)
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CurrentControlSystem</span></code>, a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">VoltageControlSystem</span></code> and some
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">BatterySpecificInformation</span></code>.  If someone wants to see what the different
values mean, they can reference the graph below.  It assumes that they
understand something about battery charging, and they do because they are
working with us on this project.</p>
<p>Ok, we know how our data is structured, now we need to go back to our behavioral
diagram and figure out how to get information from the world.</p>
<p>We go back to the electrical engineer and ask him, “How fast to I need to read
the voltage and the current?”  He says, well, I have to read these values very
quickly in the embedded device’s interrupt service routines, the control systems
will be running at 20 Khz, but you don’t have to worry about that.  Changing
between the various stages can happen slowly.  I’ll be reading the input, I’ll
use raw ADC readings to keep my code fast and I’ll use the PWM peripherals on
the part to set the output current and voltage via an H-bridge.  But I will need
you to determine which control system to run and I’ll need you to set it’s
reference.  Make it so I can tune these values later if I need to, but for now
you can sample the current, voltage and make decisions at 2 Hz”. (every 0.5
seconds)</p>
<p>You say, “Wait, I’m not controlling the current or voltage?”.  He laughs and
says, “Not with Python you aren’t, but you control which control system will
run, and you will control that controllers reference and tuning parameters,
think meta, man!”</p>
<p>Here we are seeing some of the power of statecharts.  They allow us to wrap deep
expertise inside of a system with a rich set of other features.  The electrical
engineer will manage the control system and the circuits needed to make the
device work, but that is where his expertise stops.  We need to manage which of
the control strategies are applied, and what their goals are.</p>
<p>Let’s pack this new knowledge into our pictures.  Let’s
start with the data model.  We want to attach it to our statechart so that our
statechart can use it:</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="_static/three_stage_charging_chart_2_data.pdf"><div align="center" class="align-center"><img alt="_images/three_stage_charging_chart_2_data.svg" src="_images/three_stage_charging_chart_2_data.svg" /></div>
</a>
<p>We talk to the electrical engineer again and he says, “What are those diamond
arrows?”  You answer, it’s just a way of saying one class has an attribute of
another class.  For instance the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">battery_spec</span></code> in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ChargerParameter</span></code>
class is a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">BatterySpecificInformation</span></code> class.  You leave the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">BatterySpecificInformation</span></code> class on the picture so you can see what it’s
attribute names are.</p>
<p>“It seems kind of complicated, can you just show me in code?”</p>

<p>He looks at the picture and the code for a while, then says, “Ok, I see how it
works, but why are the diamond arrows backwards?”  You answer, “The head of the
diamond describes who owns the other thing.  If you want to know why it was set
that way you will have to ask the committee that decided this in the 1990’s”</p>
<p>Then he asks, “What’s the ball and the stick?”  That’s where the data will
connect to the software that drives the charger’s behavior.  The behavior will need the
data, and if you see the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Charger</span></code> class inherits from the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CustomFactory</span></code>
class which contains all of the code that can drive behavior.  Inheritance is
just programming by difference, that arrow is like a copy and paste, it’s as if
I have copied and pasted all of that <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CustomFactory</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ChargerParameters</span></code>
code into the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Charger</span></code> class.  The ball is just short hand for saying the
data attaches to the behavior here.  The here in this case is the “charging
state” which will be described somewhere else.  He looks confused, and says, “I
guess you will have to show me when you make it.”</p>
<p>The data model seems good enough so let’s start designing the system behavior.
We need to start programming time, so we will construct three heart beats,
something that will sample the current, something that will sample the voltage and
something that will drive the statechart’s decisions.  To make a
current or a voltage readings we create two hooks in the charging state.
Finally, we make sure that these heart beats are turned off when we leave the
state; we can’t remember why this is important, but we know it is.</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="_static/three_stage_charging_chart_2_chart.pdf"><div align="center" class="align-center"><img alt="_images/three_stage_charging_chart_2_chart.svg" src="_images/three_stage_charging_chart_2_chart.svg" /></div>
</a>
<p>We also adjust the chart so that the correct control system is selected when we
enter a charging stage, and then we use our data model and our behavior to
select which current or voltage reference will be set in each stage.</p>
<p>Now we want to talk to our electrical engineer about behavior, but we know we
should accompany the statechart diagram with the electrical profile, or it might
be a bit much for him.</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="_static/three_stage_charging_chart_2_graph.pdf"><div align="center" class="align-center"><img alt="_images/three_stage_charging_chart_2_graph.svg" src="_images/three_stage_charging_chart_2_graph.svg" /></div>
</a>
<p>We show him the diagram, and say, “Listen, some stuff is missing on this, but I
just want you to look at how the current and voltage is sampled, and how the
control systems are set up.”  He says, “Ok, show me.”</p>
<p>You say, “In the entry stage we create three different named pulses that repeat
forever, or until the charging state is exited. The chart can react to these
named pulses and change state, or just run some code.”  He says, “keep going.”</p>
<p>Alright, see that <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Sample_Current</span></code> pulse, it will fire forever with a period of
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cur_in_sec</span></code> which we will probably just set to 0.5 seconds, but we can tune
it, we can make this something else if we need to.</p>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Sample_Current</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Sample_Voltage</span></code> events will be sent at the chart
and the chart will react to them, but in our case, we just hook these signals
to sample the current and voltage.  The chart won’t actually change state when
these events are seen by it, it will just use the events to update a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">curr</span></code>
and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">volt</span></code> attribute in it’s data structure so these values can be kept fresh
enough that the chart can make good decisions with the information.</p>
<p>Does that make sense?  “Yeah, it’s just a timer right?”  You answer, “Yeah, but
look there is another one, called <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Pulse</span></code>, it’s not wired up yet, but soon it
will be the thing that drives the chart’s decisions”</p>
<p>Now I’ll show you how the controllers are set up.  After the charging state is
entered, it will set up these pulses, then it will enter the bulk state.  When
it enters the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">constant_current_state</span></code>, it sets the control system to use the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CurrentControlSystem</span></code> and then when it enters the bulk state, it sets the
reference of this control system to be <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">battery_spec.ref_amps</span></code> from our data
model.</p>
<p>He looks at it for a while, and say, “Yeah, this is what I wanted, ok, yeah, I
get it.  How do I get into the other states?”  I haven’t set that up yet, but
suppose we were to enter the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">absorption</span></code> state, we would first have to enter
the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">constant_voltage_state</span></code>.  This would cause our control system to change,
we would detach the current control system, and attach the voltage control
system.  We would then use all of that control system’s <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">kp</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ki</span></code> and
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">kd</span></code> parameters.  “Yeah, ok, good, this is what I wanted”.</p>
<p>Things seem to be coming together, so we go back and work on our spec:</p>
