<p>Lead acid batteries are very heavy.  But they are cheaper than lithium ion
batteries and this is why they are used in a lot of off-grid electrical systems.</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="https://www.lowtechmagazine.com/2015/05/sustainability-off-grid-solar-power.html"><img alt="https://krisdedecker.typepad.com/.a/6a00e0099229e8883301bb0820445e970d-pi" class="align-center" src="https://krisdedecker.typepad.com/.a/6a00e0099229e8883301bb0820445e970d-pi" /></a>
<p>A large lead-acid battery is made up of a set of smaller lead-acid batteries
connected together in series.  These smaller batteries are called cells.</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="https://chargetek.com/images/pdfs/equal.pdf"><img alt="_images/cells_in_series.PNG" class="align-center" src="_images/cells_in_series.PNG" /></a>
<p>Each cell contains two terminals, and each terminal is connected to a plate that
reaches down into a bath of sulphuric acid (H2SO4) and water (H2O).  There is a
positive and a negative terminal.  The positive terminal of a cell is made up of
lead dioxide (PbO2) and the negative terminal is made out of lead (Pb).</p>
<p>A battery is a chemical reaction that wants to happen, but can’t until there is
a path for electrons to flow from one material to another.  As a result, there
is a voltage potential expressed across the positive and negative terminals of
the battery.  If an electrical device is connected across these terminals an
electron path is made, the battery can begin its chemical reaction.  As a side
effect the electrical device is powered on.  The flow of current leaves the
positive terminal and enters the negative terminal.  When this happens the
battery is said to discharge.</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="https://circuitglobe.com/lead-acid-battery.html"><img alt="https://circuitglobe.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/lead-acid-cell-112.jpg" class="align-center" src="https://circuitglobe.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/lead-acid-cell-112.jpg" /></a>
<p>Charging of a battery occurs when current is forced to flow in the opposite
direction: current leaves the negative terminal and enters the positive
terminal. This causes the chemical reaction to reverse, sequestering the
electrons back into the various materials of the battery.  You can charge a
battery with a battery charger.</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="https://circuitglobe.com/lead-acid-battery.html"><img alt="https://circuitglobe.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/recharging-of-lead-acid-battery.jpg" class="align-center" src="https://circuitglobe.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/recharging-of-lead-acid-battery.jpg" /></a>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>If you aren’t familiar with the terminology of electricity, imagine a water
tower.  The water is trying to get to the ground, due to gravity,
but it is held in place by the walls of the tower.  This means that there is a
potential for the water to flow, the height of the tower determines how much
energy is stored within it.  The higher the tower, the higher the potential
energy.  Voltage is analogous to height of the held water in the tower.</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTtYw4fJS9o3meW9yv5ZGJ5enzVpyJ0sfw5L45UifmATQERiArD"><img alt="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTtYw4fJS9o3meW9yv5ZGJ5enzVpyJ0sfw5L45UifmATQERiArD" class="align-center" src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTtYw4fJS9o3meW9yv5ZGJ5enzVpyJ0sfw5L45UifmATQERiArD" /></a>
<p>Now imagine connecting a pipe from the tower to the ground, and letting the
water flow through it.  This flow is like current in an electrical system, and
the pipe width would limit that flow, so that would be like an electrical load.</p>
<p>Our battery is like a water tower; if no pipe is connected, current can’t flow.
If a pipe is connected, it can, and the energy of the battery reduces just like
the potential energy of our water tower would reduce as it’s water leaves it
through a pipe.  If you were to push the current back into the pipe, by
connecting a higher water tower, or by just driving the current back up the
tube with a pump, you would cause the potential of the water tower to increase.
We would be charging the tower.</p>
<p class="last">As mentioned before, a battery is made up of stacking cells in series.  Think of
that as a very tall water tower made up of stacked shorter water towers.  You
can increase their potential energy by stacking them this way.</p>
</div>
<p>As a lead acid battery is discharged, a crust of lead sulphate (PbSO4) forms on the
plates.  This crust reduces the surface area of the lead plates exposed to the
acid, reducing its ability to react and drive current.</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="https://stevedmarineconsulting.com/sulfation-too-many-batteries-die-an-unnecessarily-early-death-from-this-phenomenon/"><img alt="https://stevedmarineconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/082504179.jpg" class="align-center" src="https://stevedmarineconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/082504179.jpg" /></a>
<p>There are electrical charging techniques which can remove this lead sulphate
(PbSO4), by reversing the chemical reaction, and even sometimes bubbling the
acid.  These bubbles physically massage away the lead sulphate crystals,
dislodging them from the plate, dropping them into the acid bath where they can
break down, crystallizing their lead atoms back onto the plates.</p>
<p>An electrical charger can control one of two things, it can act to control
current flow or it can control the voltage across the terminals of the
battery.  If it holds the current constant, electrons are pushed back into the
battery, which will cause the voltage of the battery to slowly rise over time.</p>
<p>If the charger holds the voltage at a higher potential than the battery voltage,
current will flow into the battery.  At first it will flow quickly, but over
time the battery’s ability to accept electrons will be limited by the amount of
material within it, causing the current flow to subside.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">Thinking back to the water tower.  If we re-filled our water tower using a
pump to push a constant amount of water, this would be like controlling the
current being pushed into the battery.  If we connected a higher water tower,
and let it passively drain some of its water into the lower tower, this would
be like controlling the voltage of our charger.  Together the two towers
would have the potential energy of the taller tower, so it’s voltage would be
set to this.</p>
</div>
<p>When you hear people talk about the stages of charging of a battery, they are
talking about either a constant current or a constant voltage charging
technique.  In two stage charging, a constant current technique starts the
charging process, then once the battery voltage rises to a high enough level, a
constant voltage technique takes over.  In three stage charging, the third stage
is a constant voltage technique, but held at a lower value than the second
stage.  A forth stage of charging can be applied very infrequently, it’s called
equalization.  It is a constant voltage technique that applies such a high
voltage across the battery terminals, that the acid boils, and explosive
hydrogen is expelled from the batteries (this is why battery rooms need to be
well vented).</p>
<p>There are arbitrary naming conventions that have been applied to these stages of
charging:</p>

<colgroup>
<col width="28%" />
<col width="13%" />
<col width="13%" />

<p>A charger is typically called one of these:</p>

<td>bulk followed by the float stage</td>

<tr class="row-even"><td><em>three stage charger</em></td>
<td>bulk followed by absorption, followed by float</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The <em>equalization</em> stage is so dangerous that it doesn’t happen automatically,
it has to be manually set by the user.</p>
<p>It has been found that when you charge batteries with three stage chargers, the
process of plate sulphation is slower than it would be with a two stage charger.
If such a charger is also equipped with the equalization feature, a knowledgeable
user can keep their battery’s healthy for a long time.</p>
<p>Let’s look at the three stage charging electrical profile:</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="_static/three_stage_charging_all.pdf"><div align="center" class="align-center"><img alt="_images/three_stage_charging_all.svg" src="_images/three_stage_charging_all.svg" /></div>
</a>
<p>That diagram is not going to win any graphic design awards, but it shows you
everything you need to know about building a charger.  We need two control
systems, one that can hold current to a constant level and one that can hold the
voltage to a constant level.  We need to track time, so that we can exit a stage
if the charger has been in it too long.  And we need to be able to set some
parameters based on the kind of battery we are attached too.</p>
<p>The bulk stage is where the battery is charged quickly.  Charging the battery is
what our customer’s care about the most, but battery maintenance is very
important too.</p>
<p>The charger will have a rated current, the more money we put into its hardware,
the higher this current can be.  The problem is if we over-build this, our
charger will be too big for a lot of systems and these customers will buy
someone else’s product because it is cheaper than ours.</p>
<p>A way to solve this problem is to build a charger that can be ganged together
with more versions of itself.  That way we can keep the costs low, and if a
customer needs a lot of current, they can buy as many of our products as they
need and gang them together in parallel.</p>
<p>The added benefit of this approach is that if one of their chargers fails, there
batteries can still be charged by the others in their system.  It offers them
some resilience.  If they felt so inclined, they could actually over-build their
charging system to increase their system’s reliability (think military
contracts).  Batteries are expensive, heavy and dangerous, and chargers are
relatively cheap and easy to work with and install.</p>
<p>Another problem our customers have is with the parameters.  We can’t expect them
to figure out what all of the values and time-outs mean.  They really don’t
care, we need to eat this complexity on their behalf, especially if we are
expecting them to buy a bunch of our products for a single installation.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Often the hardest thing to do on a project is to pack knowledge into a
specification (spec).  The specification should be simple and full of pictures,
if it isn’t nobody will look a it, and nobody will change it to match what the
system actually does.  Engineers talk with pictures, because pictures transmit
more information than writing.  Pictures also illicit conversation which moves
relevant personal knowledge into project knowledge:  When you are talking to
technical people they often forget that they know a lot of things you don’t
know. If you are both pointing to and talking about a picture, you will both
learn more about each others contribution and thinking in regards to the
project.  Once things are discovered from one another they should be packed into
a couple of notes and pictures and added to the spec.</p>
<p>The spec should be short enough that it can be read and understood by everyone
involved.  If specific drawings are too technical for some members, efforts
should be made to explain what they mean so everyone can participate in the
conversation.  Here is an example of such a conversation to discover how to
build a single three stage battery charger.  But if you want to skip the
conversation and just jump to the design, click <a class="reference internal" href="#batterychargingexample-single-unit-three-stage-battery-charger-design"><span class="std std-ref">here</span></a>.</p>

<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">New knowledge and things said by other imagined people will be
<span class="new-spec">highlighted.</span></p>
</div>
<p>Specification (1):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><span class="new-spec">A charger has two control systems: constant current and constant voltage.</span></li>
<li><span class="new-spec">The bulk stage is a constant current control technique.</span></li>
<li><span class="new-spec">The absorption, float and equalization stages are constant voltage control
techniques.</span></li>
</ul>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="_static/three_stage_charging_chart_1.pdf"><div align="center" class="align-center"><img alt="_images/three_stage_charging_chart_1.svg" src="_images/three_stage_charging_chart_1.svg" /></div>
</a>
<p>I show the above diagram to the <span class="new-spec">electrical engineer</span> I’m working with, and he says,
<span class="new-spec">Yeah, it looks good, but can you make sure the two control systems are
generalizeable?</span>  What do you mean?  <span class="new-spec">Well, I want to just give the current
control system a reference current and it will drive the device to output that
current.  The same idea applies to the voltage controller.</span>  He continues,
<span class="new-spec">A control system is just some math, you give it a goal called a “reference”.
then you give it the value of the thing it is trying to control, call this the
“input” and the math will drive the “output” towards the goal.  We connect
this output value to our hardware and it will behave as expected.  I want to use
the same math to solve the current and voltage control problems, so give me a
reference and give me the input and I’ll make it work.</span></p>
<p>You turn to leave and he says, <span class="new-spec">Oh, one more thing, I need to tune the
two control systems differently, so make sure I can set some variables “ki”,
“kp” and “kd”.  That should be good</span>.</p>
<p>So now we have to start thinking about all of the parameters, each can be
changed for a different battery type.  We change the language on the diagram to
match how our electrical engineer talks about things.</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="_static/three_stage_charging_chart_1.pdf"><div align="center" class="align-center"><img alt="_images/three_stage_charging_parameters.svg" src="_images/three_stage_charging_parameters.svg" /></div>
</a>
<p>After we update the image we show our electrical engineer the new picture.  He
looks at it and asks, <span class="new-spec">What are these arrows connecting the boxes
together?</span> You answer, it’s just a way of saying that the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">reference</span></code>,
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">input</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">kp</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ki</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">kd</span></code> values will be in both of the current and
voltage control classes.  It’s just a drawing short hand.   He says,
<span class="new-spec">Ok, it looks good.</span></p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Specification (2):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A charger has two control systems: constant current and constant voltage.</li>
<li>The bulk stage is a constant current control technique.</li>
<li>The absorption, float and equalization stages are constant voltage control
techniques.</li>
<li><span class="new-spec">The electrical profile of the system will look like this:</span></li>
</ul>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="_static/three_stage_charging_chart_1.pdf"><div align="center" class="align-center"><img alt="_images/three_stage_charging_parameters.svg" src="_images/three_stage_charging_parameters.svg" /></div>
</a>
<ul class="simple">
<li><span class="new-spec">The behavior of the system will look like this:</span></li>
</ul>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="_static/three_stage_charging_chart_1.pdf"><div align="center" class="align-center"><img alt="_images/three_stage_charging_chart_1.svg" src="_images/three_stage_charging_chart_1.svg" /></div>
</a>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>But we still haven’t solved the parameter issue.  To create a data structure
that has the control system information and the battery stuff in one place we
adjust our data model to look like this:</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="_static/three_stage_charging_parameters_2.pdf"><div align="center" class="align-center"><img alt="_images/three_stage_charging_parameters_2.svg" src="_images/three_stage_charging_parameters_2.svg" /></div>
</a>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ChargerParameter</span></code> class “has a” (black diamond arrow)
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CurrentControlSystem</span></code>, a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">VoltageControlSystem</span></code> and some
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">BatterySpecificInformation</span></code>.</p>
<p>Now that we have a plan for structuring our data, we need to go back to our
behavioral diagram and figure out how to get information from the world.</p>
<p>We track down our electrical engineer and ask him, “How fast to I need to read
the voltage and the current?”  He says, <span class="new-spec">Well, I have to read these
values very quickly in the embedded device’s interrupt service routines, the
control systems will be running at 20 Khz, but you don’t have to worry about
that.  Changing between the various stages can happen slowly.  I’ll be reading
the input, I’ll use raw ADC readings to keep my code fast and I’ll use the PWM
peripherals on the part to set the output current and voltage via an H-bridge.
But I will need you to determine which control system to run and I’ll need you
to set it’s reference.  Make it so I can tune these values later if I need to,
but for now you can sample the current, voltage and make decisions at 2 Hz”.
(every 0.5 seconds)</span></p>
<p>You say, “Wait, I’m not controlling the current or voltage?”.</p>
<p>He laughs and says, <span class="new-spec">Not with Python you aren’t, but you control which
control system will run, and you will control that controllers reference and
tuning parameters, think meta, man!</span></p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Here we are seeing some of the power of statecharts.  They allow us to wrap deep
expertise inside of a system with a rich set of other features.  The electrical
engineer will manage the control system and the circuits needed to make the
device work, but that is where his expertise stops.  We need to manage which of
the control strategies are applied, and what their goals are.</p>
<p>Let’s pack this new knowledge into our pictures.  Let’s start with the data
model.  We want to attach it to our statechart so that our statechart can use
it:</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="_static/three_stage_charging_chart_2_data.pdf"><div align="center" class="align-center"><img alt="_images/three_stage_charging_chart_2_data.svg" src="_images/three_stage_charging_chart_2_data.svg" /></div>
</a>
<p>We show our design to the electrical engineer and he says, <span class="new-spec">What are
those diamond arrows?</span></p>
<p>You answer, “It’s just a way of saying one class has an
attribute of another class.  For instance the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">battery_spec</span></code> in the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ChargerParameter</span></code> class is a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">BatterySpecificInformation</span></code> class.  You leave
the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">BatterySpecificInformation</span></code> class on the picture so you can see what it’s
attribute names are.”</p>
<p><span class="new-spec">It seems kind of complicated, can you just show me in code?</span></p>

<p>He looks at the picture and the code for a while, then says, <span class="new-spec">OK, I
see how it works, but why are the diamond arrows backwards?</span></p>
<p>You answer, “The head of the diamond describes who owns the other thing.  If you
want to know why it was set that way you will have to ask the committee that
decided this in the 1990’s”</p>
<p>Then he asks, <span class="new-spec">What’s the ball and the stick?</span></p>
<p>“That’s where the data will connect to the software that drives the charger’s
behavior.  The behavior will need the data, and if you see the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Charger</span></code> class
inherits from the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CustomFactory</span></code> class which contains all of the code that
can drive behavior.  Inheritance is just programming by difference, that arrow
is like a copy and paste, it’s as if I have copied and pasted all of that
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CustomFactory</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ChargerParameters</span></code> code into the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Charger</span></code> class.
The ball is just short hand for saying the data attaches to the behavior here.
The “here” in this case is the “charging state” which will be described
somewhere else.”</p>
<p>He looks confused, and says, <span class="new-spec">I guess you will have to show me when you make it.</span></p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The data model seems good enough so let’s start designing the system behavior.
We need to start programming time, so we will construct three heart beats,
something that will sample the current, something that will sample the voltage
and something that will drive the statechart’s decisions.  To make current and
voltage readings, we create two hooks in the charging state.  Finally, we make
sure that these heart beats are turned off when we leave the state; we can’t
remember why this is important, but we know it is.</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="_static/three_stage_charging_chart_2_chart.pdf"><div align="center" class="align-center"><img alt="_images/three_stage_charging_chart_2_chart.svg" src="_images/three_stage_charging_chart_2_chart.svg" /></div>
</a>
<p>We also adjust the chart so that the correct control system is selected when we
enter a charging stage, and then we use our data model and our behavior to
select which current or voltage reference will be set in each stage.</p>
<p>Now we want to talk to our electrical engineer about behavior, but we know we
should accompany the statechart diagram with the electrical profile, or it might
be a bit much for him.</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="_static/three_stage_charging_chart_2_graph.pdf"><div align="center" class="align-center"><img alt="_images/three_stage_charging_chart_2_graph.svg" src="_images/three_stage_charging_chart_2_graph.svg" /></div>
</a>
<p>We show him the diagram, and say, “Listen, some stuff is missing on this, but I
just want you to look at how the current and voltage are sampled, and how the
control systems are set up.”  He says, <span class="new-spec">Ok, show me.</span></p>
<p>You say, “In the entry stage we create three different named pulses that repeat
forever, or until the charging state is exited. The chart can react to these
named pulses and change state, or just run some code.” I pause and look at him,
he says, <span class="new-spec">Keep going.</span></p>
<p>“Alright, see that <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Sample_Current</span></code> pulse, it will fire forever with a period of
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cur_in_sec</span></code> which we will probably just set to 0.5 seconds, but we can tune
it, we can make this something else if we need to.”</p>
<p>“The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Sample_Current</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Sample_Voltage</span></code> events will be sent at the chart
and the chart will react to them, but in our case, we just hook these signals
to sample the current and voltage.  The chart won’t actually change state when
these events are seen by it, it will just use the events to update a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">curr</span></code>
and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">volt</span></code> attribute in it’s data structure so these values can be kept fresh
enough that the chart can make good decisions with the information.”</p>
<p>“Does that make sense?”  <span class="new-spec">Yeah, it’s just a timer right?</span>  You answer,
“Yeah, but look there is another one, called <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Pulse</span></code>, it’s not wired up yet,
but soon it will be the thing that drives the chart’s decisions”</p>
<p>“Now I’ll show you how the controllers are set up.  After the charging state is
entered, it will set up these pulses, then it will enter the bulk state.  When
it enters the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">constant_current_state</span></code>, it sets the control system to use the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CurrentControlSystem</span></code> and then when it enters the bulk state, it sets the
reference of this control system to be <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">battery_spec.ref_amps</span></code> from our data
model.”</p>
<p>He looks at it for a while, and says, <span class="new-spec">Yeah, this is what I wanted, ok,
yeah, I get it.  How do I get into the other states?</span>  “I haven’t set that up
yet, but suppose we were to enter the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">absorption</span></code> state, we would first have
to enter the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">constant_voltage_state</span></code>.  This would cause our control system to
change, we would detach the current control system, and attach the voltage
control system.  We would then use all of that control system’s <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">kp</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ki</span></code>
and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">kd</span></code> parameters.”  <span class="new-spec">Yeah, ok, good, this is what I wanted.</span></p>
<p>Things seem to be coming together, so we go back and work on our spec, teasing
apart our high level descriptions from our technical design.</p>

<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Let’s wire up the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Pulse</span></code> event and add more functionality to our chart.  We
want the charger to:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>change it’s charging state to match our electrical/time profile</li>
<li>be able to be forced into any of the charge states</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Here is a new design that does these things:</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="_static/three_stage_charging_chart_3_chart.pdf"><div align="center" class="align-center"><img alt="_images/three_stage_charging_chart_3_chart.svg" src="_images/three_stage_charging_chart_3_chart.svg" /></div>
</a>
<p>Since there is a need for timeouts in various states, we invent a new signal
called <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Tick</span></code>.  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Tick</span></code> is driven by our <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Pulse</span></code> event, and it is given a payload
which is the time in seconds since the charging state was entered.</p>
<p>Time to show our electrical engineer.</p>
<p>We approach him with the diagrams and he says, <span class="new-spec">Ok walk me through
it</span>.  “When the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">charging</span></code> state is entered the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sec</span></code> is set to 0, then the
three heart beats are initiated.  Two of the heart beats drive the current and
voltage readings, but the third heart beat, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Pulse</span></code>, will fire every
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pulse_sec</span></code> seconds.  We will probably set <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pulse_sec</span></code> to 0.5.  The key
thing to notice on this picture is that Pulse drives another event called
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Tick</span></code> which is given a payload of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sec</span></code> which is how much time has passed
since the charging state was entered.”</p>
<p><span class="new-spec">Wait, how does this tick thing work?</span>.  “When system turns on the
first thing that will happen is it will enter the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">charging</span></code> state. When the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">charging</span></code> state is entered a bunch of heart beats are setup, these are
basically named timers, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Sample_Current</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Sample_Voltage</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Pulse</span></code>.
Then the charging state initializes, causing a transition into the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bulk</span></code>
state.  While this happens, the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">constant_current_state</span></code> is entered, setting
the control system to use your current control system, then it enters the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bulk</span></code> state, which sets the reference of your current control system.”  He
looks at the diagram and after some time says, <span class="new-spec">Ok, yeah, I see that,
but how does this pulse stuff work?</span></p>
<p>“The Pulse event will fire every, say 0.5 seconds, but it is caught by a hook,
which invents another signal called <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Tick</span></code> which has a payload, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sec</span></code>.  The
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sec</span></code> payload of the Tick signal will have the time in seconds since the
charging state was entered.  It’s this <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Tick</span></code> event, which can make stuff
happen.  Do you see it?”  <span class="new-spec">I see it.  So how do these charging stage
time outs work?  Can you show me the electrical profile and the statechart
timing mechanisms together?</span></p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="_static/three_stage_charging_chart_3_graph.pdf"><div align="center" class="align-center"><img alt="_images/three_stage_charging_chart_3_graph.svg" src="_images/three_stage_charging_chart_3_graph.svg" /></div>
</a>
<p>“Ok, so first of all we enter the bulk state, then we start getting <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Tick</span></code>
events with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sec</span></code> payloads representing the amount of time in seconds since
the beginning of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">charging</span></code>.  Notice that when the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bulk</span></code> state is entered,
the time at which this happened is squirreled away in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">start_sec</span></code>
attribute.  From then on, every <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pulse_sec</span></code> a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Tick</span></code> signal will be seen by
the bulk state.  Your current control system will charge the battery.  While this
is happening the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bulk</span></code> state will see a whole lot of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Tick</span></code> events which it
will ignore.  But once the time in bulk is equal to or greater than
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">abs_timeout_sec</span></code> or if the battery voltage is equal to or greater than
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bulk_exit_volt</span></code>, the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bulk</span></code> state will post a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">To_Abs</span></code> event to the chart.”</p>
<p>“The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">To_Abs</span></code> event, will cause an exit from the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bulk</span></code> state, then an exit
from the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">constant_current_control</span></code> state.  Then it will enter into the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">constant_voltage_control</span></code> state, which will switch the control system to use
a voltage controller, then enter the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">absorption</span></code> state which will set the
voltage reference to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">abs_ref_volts</span></code>”.  <span class="new-spec">I see how it works and I
see how the same thing happens for transitions to float from absorption.  Also,
I see that you can only force your way into the equalize state, that’s good eh.</span></p>
<p>He looks a bit longer and says, <span class="new-spec">So the charger will try and spend
most of its time in float eh? But how to we get back into bulk if there is a big
draw on the batteries? Say our customer has a big DC load that draws the voltage
down below the bulk_entry_volts.  What happens then?</span></p>
<p>You look at the chart and see that you can’t get back into bulk, “Right now you
can’t, I missed that, but let me fix it”  You spend a moment adjusting the
chart, “Look at this:”</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="_static/three_stage_charging_chart_3_chart_1.pdf"><div align="center" class="align-center"><img alt="_images/three_stage_charging_chart_3_chart_1.svg" src="_images/three_stage_charging_chart_3_chart_1.svg" /></div>
</a>
<p>“See how I adjusted the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Sample_Voltage</span></code> hook to post a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">To_Bulk</span></code> signal when
the voltage is below the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bulk_entry_volts</span></code>.  I have added a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">To_Bulk</span></code> hook
in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bulk</span></code> state which blocks this event from causing a transition from
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">charging</span></code> to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bulk</span></code> while the unit is in bulk but the voltage is still
lower than the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bulk_exit_volts</span></code>.”  He asks, <span class="new-spec">Why would that happen?</span>.  “The
charger would probably need some time to get the voltage above the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bulk_entry_volts</span></code> once it fell below this threshold, maybe because of a big
DC draw on the battery.”  He says, <span class="new-spec">Yeah, that will probably happen in
some situations</span>.</p>
<p>You ask him, “Do we need to separate the timing of our current, voltage and
decision pulses?”  He says, <span class="new-spec">No, it’s not that important, what’s the
cost of having extra timers anyway?</span>  “It’s not a big deal, just each heart beat
will have it’s own thread, and when I’m looking at the logs it could get kind of
cluttered having all of those signals firing at the same time.  So, maybe I could
simplify the design by just having one heart beat.”  <span class="new-spec">Yeah, simple is
good, we probably won’t need separate timers.</span></p>
<p>You spend a moment adjusting the chart.  “Here, it’s less cluttered now”:</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="_static/three_stage_charging_chart_3_chart_2.pdf"><div align="center" class="align-center"><img alt="_images/three_stage_charging_chart_3_chart_2.svg" src="_images/three_stage_charging_chart_3_chart_2.svg" /></div>
</a>
<p>Do you see anything else we could pull out of there?  <span class="new-spec">No, it seems
pretty compact, how are you going to test this thing anyway?  I’m not going to
have hardware for you for a couple of weeks, can you test it before that?</span>.
“I will run it on a PC and feed it fake electrical profiles, I also plan
to squeeze time so I can run it through all of it’s states quickly”.</p>
<p>Things seem to be coming together, so we go back and work on our spec, teasing
apart our high level descriptions from our technical design.</p>

<p>Our electrical engineer comes up to us, <span class="new-spec">How is it going?</span>, you
answer, “No plan ever survives first contact with the enemy.”</p>
<p><span class="new-spec">That well hey?</span> “It’s going well enough, I have the data model and
statechart written, I can see that it might be working, and I only had to change
a few things in the design do get it there.  Now I have to figure out how to
test it. I have no idea if it actually works”</p>
<p><span class="new-spec">Any ideas?</span>.  “I would like to feed in a graph or a CSV file, and
have the statechart respond to the graph.  I would have to instrument it in such
a way that the statechart’s log output would be easy to interpret next to the
graph.”</p>
<p><span class="new-spec">If you figure that out, i would like to use it too.  that’s the nice
thing about software, it’s so gullible, it’s so easy to lie to software eh?</span> You
look at him for a while, and say, “Yeah, I guess you are right, maybe I could
mock it out using dependency injection via subclassing or something like that”.
<span class="new-spec">Why do you software guys always invent these complicated names for
things?</span></p>
<p>You think for a while and surprise him with an answer, “I think it happens
because we try to keep everything as general as possible, and we aren’t that
creative about naming, because naming isn’t the thing we think is important at
the time. We are usually trying to solve some other specific problem when we
have to come up with a name.  So, a name just becomes the first, most general
description that pops into our mind, and first ideas are usually bad. But
we don’t care because we don’t think that the name is important when we invent
it. Then that name sticks, and whatever the specific problem we were trying to
solve is forgotten. Nobody has control of the language once it is released to
the public (unless you are French), so the dumb language just lingers like a bad
smell”</p>
<p>He laughs and says, <span class="new-spec">Well at least you aren’t using Latin.  I think
your industry comes up with bad names because the names are made by academics,
and they will increase their chances of being published, – paid –, if they
make things sound as complicated and mysterious as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="new-spec">Why don’t you just add your testing design into the spec, this stuff
you have written needs to work, or you could burn down someone’s house eh?  No
pressure, eh?  Just add it to the spec, then make it happen.  Oh, and try and
keep your gobbledegook out of the spec, I have to read it too.</span></p>

<hr class="docutils" />
<p>I approach my electrical engineer, “Hey, can I get some help about how to think
about my model?” <span class="new-spec">Sure, what do you need to know that you don’t know
already?</span>.</p>
<p>“Well, I need to build something that will give me different voltages over time
after I feed the bulk current, and different current when I feed a constant
voltage”</p>
<p><span class="new-spec">Hold on, show me what you want</span>.  You place the electrical profile in
front of him:</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="_static/three_stage_charging_chart_2_graph.pdf"><div align="center" class="align-center"><img alt="_images/three_stage_charging_chart_2_graph.svg" src="_images/three_stage_charging_chart_2_graph.svg" /></div>
</a>
<p>“I have to be able to fake out these electrical profiles.  Any ideas?”</p>
<p><span class="new-spec">Yeah, I can help you with that, but first you have to understand a
few things about batteries.  Do you have time for that?</span></p>
<p>“Of course.”</p>
<p><span class="new-spec">Ok, well, batteries are very complicated, their behaviors are
effected by their chemistry, age, the temperature, how fast they have been
discharged, how they have been charged.. it goes on.  But, there are some common
ways of thinking about battery characteristics.  Once you understand some of
these ideas, I will draw some pictures which simplify how a battery works well
enough so that you can build your software model.</span></p>
<p><span class="new-spec">Now suppose, the battery in your car is “dead”.  It still has some
charge in it, but it can’t drive enough current to turn your car on.  When you
place a voltage meter across its terminals you see that it measures 11 volts.
That’s lower than it should be, so you connect a trickle charger across the
terminals and plug it in.  When you measure the battery terminal voltage again,
you see that it’s the same as the voltage of the trickle charger, 13.5 Volts.
You go and get a cup of coffee.  Later, you come back to your car and out of
curiosity, you disconnect the charger and measure the battery voltage, then you
watch the number on your meter fall from 13 to 12 to 11.5.  It stabilizes onto
11.5 V.  This stabilized voltage is called the “Open Circuit Voltage” of the
battery.</span></p>
<p><span class="new-spec">The “Open Circuit Voltage” is a kind of hidden state.  When the
charger was connected, we could not read this “Open Circuit Voltage” from the
terminals, because the charger was holding the voltage at 13.5 V.</span></p>
<p><span class="new-spec">But, this “Open Circuit Voltage” isn’t what you really care about,
you just want to turn your car on right?  To do that, your battery will need to
drive enough current to crank your engine and start the car.  When you drive
charge through a circuit it’s called current, or how much charge passes through
the circuit in a given amount of time.  If your battery is “dead”, it means that
the charge it is holding is less than the charge you need to deliver to your
car’s starter for the time needed for the engine to start.</span></p>
<p>He pauses for a moment and takes a breath.  Then he says,  <span class="new-spec">But how
much charge can your battery hold anyway?  Well The total amount of charge a
battery can hold is dependent upon it’s physical size and its chemistry.  A
battery’s capacity to store charge will go down over time, since you break down
some of the materials required to make the electro-chemical reaction as you
charge and discharge the battery.  But your *new* battery would have been rated
in “amp-hours”.  This “amp-hours” rating describes the constant current it could
deliver for one full hour.</span></p>
<p><span class="new-spec">To make it easy to compare the characteristics of batteries of
different “amp-hour” ratings, we talk about it indirectly, we talk about the
“state of charge” of the battery, or what percentage of charge exists in the
battery.  For our car, when the battery was dead, this might have been 10
percent.  When we tested it, after having the coffee, it might have been 25
percent.  It turns out that measuring the “state of charge” of a battery is a very
challenging problem.</span></p>
<p><span class="new-spec">So you climb in your car, and try the engine again and hurray, it
starts.  You drive to work, and here you are with me, now we have a different
problem. You need to make a battery model to test your software, eh?</span></p>
<p><span class="new-spec">Let me show you how the “Open Circuit Voltage” relates to a lead
acid battery’s “State of Charge”.  It kind of looks like this</span>.  He draws this
on a napkin:</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="_static/ocv_soc.pdf"><div align="center" class="align-center"><img alt="_images/ocv_soc.svg" src="_images/ocv_soc.svg" /></div>
</a>
<p><span class="new-spec">Now get this, for a lead acid battery, it takes 24 hours for the open
circuit voltage to stabilize.  So if you wanted to make that graph, you would
have to completely discharge a battery, then wait a day then charge it a bit and
wait a day, and a couple of months later you would have a graph.  I’m glad I
don’t have to do that.  God bless the researcher.  Oh! And get this: the curve
changes depending on direction of the charge flow, you will make a different
graph if you start from a dead battery and incrementally charge it,  or if you
start from a full battery and incrementally discharge it. So things can get
complicated.</span></p>
<p>“Yeah, it seems that way.”</p>
<p><span class="new-spec">Don’t worry, your simulator doesn’t have to be that good.  You just
want to generate currents and voltages that kind of look like something we could
get from a lead acid system.</span></p>
<p><span class="new-spec">Now remember what I said about the “Open circuit Voltage” being a
hidden voltage within the battery? To make a simple equivalent circuit, we
pretend that the battery has a resistor in series with its hidden “Open circuit
Voltage”</span>:</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="_static/battery_model_1.pdf"><div align="center" class="align-center"><img alt="_images/battery_model_1.svg" src="_images/battery_model_1.svg" /></div>
</a>
<p><span class="new-spec">Look</span>  He points to the diagram. <span class="new-spec">When there is no current
the voltage across the resistor falls to zero and the “Open circuit Voltage” is
expressed at the battery terminals.</span>  He pauses and waits.  “I see that”.</p>
<p><span class="new-spec">When a constant voltage charger is connected, the “Battery Terminal Voltage”
is equal to the voltage across the resistor plus the “Open Circuit Voltage”.
You can calculate the current, then use that information to update the battery’s
state of charge, for your next increment of time.</span></p>
<p><span class="new-spec">When a constant current charger is connected, the “Battery Terminal
Voltage” is equal to the voltage across the resistor plus the “Open Circuit
Voltage”.  You can calculate the V_r and add it to the “Open Circuit Voltage”
and that will be your terminal voltage.  Like before, you can use the current to
update the battery’s state of charge for your next increment of time.</span></p>
<p><span class="new-spec">You now know enough to make a simulator.  But there is something else
I think you should add to it.  We are going to over-charge the battery, and we
aren’t going to let the battery settle to its true open circuit voltage.  We will be
charging at c/3.</span></p>
<p>You ask, “What is c?”</p>
<p><span class="new-spec">C is a measure of the rate of the battery’s charge or discharge.  If
your battery was rated at 1Ah it should be able to source 1 Amp for 1 hour.  If
you discharged at 2C your battery could source 2 Amps for 30 minutes.</span></p>
<p>“Then why don’t we charge at 5C or 100C?  Why wait around?”</p>
<p><span class="new-spec">Heat.  Your lead-acid battery would probably bubble and explode in
flames if you did that.  Think flaming acid, eh?  I don’t know what would happen,
but it would be bad.  See that equivalent resistor in the diagram, it does a
decent job of modelling what is happening in our system.  The heat produced from
the battery while we charge it is proportional to the current times itself.
This squared relationship limits how fast we can charge the system.</span></p>
<p><span class="new-spec">I probably should have explained the C-rating first, since it’s
actually from this that the amp-hour rating comes from.  Battery manufacturers
cheat using these ideas.</span></p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p><span class="new-spec">Well, if you discharge your battery over a very very long time, you
avoid losing energy through heat.  So, if you discharge a full battery at 0.2C,
or 5 hours, then set your battery’s amp hour rating based on this information,
you will fool your customer into thinking that your battery can source this
amp-hour rating at 1 hour.  This is not true, there is a non-linear relationship
which means you will produce a lot of heat and you won’t get anywhere near as
much current as has been advertized.</span></p>
<p>“Wow, so the rating isn’t the rating?”</p>
<p><span class="new-spec">Well, it’s all complicated, so the manufacturers find ways of making
their numbers look better than their competition’s numbers.  The market settles
things out.  Anyway, an amp-hour rating really isn’t what they say it is, so we
will charge at C/3 to avoid any problems.</span></p>
<p>“Wait a minute, if we can’t trust the ratings, how can you safely charge the
battery?”</p>
<p><span class="new-spec">Don’t worry, C/3 is typically ok, and we will also attach a battery
temperature sensor.  If the temperature gets too high we will change the control
system’s reference to a lower number, reducing the amount of current sourced
from our charger.</span></p>
<p><span class="new-spec">Here is the graph I would like you to use:</span></p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="_static/ocv_soc_2.pdf"><div align="center" class="align-center"><img alt="_images/ocv_soc_2.svg" src="_images/ocv_soc_2.svg" /></div>
</a>
<p><span class="new-spec">Use the blue line.</span></p>
<p>“This graph doesn’t really make any sense to me, you said the open circuit
voltage on a lead acid battery can’t be found for 24 hours, how can we talk
about it while we are charging?”</p>
<p><span class="new-spec">Exactly, the black line is the one a researcher might get for us, and
the blue line is the “hidden” voltage of our battery while we charge at c/3.
It’s technically not an “open circuit voltage” anymore because we won’t let the
voltage truly settle, but it’s useful anyway.  Imagine that it was measured 20
seconds after we have disconnected the charger.  The blue line represents a kind
of instantaneous hidden voltage of the battery.  But, if you were to stop
charging at some point along the x-axis, in 24 hours the voltage would settle to
the black line for the same state of charge. I just want you to make the line go
up once we have over-charged the battery.  Like with horse shoes and hand
grenades, we just need to be close enough.</span></p>
<p>“How can I put more than 100 percent charge in the battery?”</p>
<p><span class="new-spec">Good question, you can’t really, but if you drive more current than
what it was rated for, the voltage will start to go up like I drew on the
picture.  This is a useful property it tells us when we are done, so I would
like you to add it to your model.</span></p>
<p><span class="new-spec">Use this equivalent circuit:</span></p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="_static/battery_model_2.pdf"><div align="center" class="align-center"><img alt="_images/battery_model_2.svg" src="_images/battery_model_2.svg" /></div>
</a>
<p>“What numbers should I use?”  <span class="new-spec">I would like you to make your battery
model parameterizable, but for now set the far right knee on the graph to 13.0
V.  Make your model’s “C/3” profile dependent upon data, since this is
all emperical stuff.  Good luck!</span></p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>You grab a pad of paper and a pencil and head out to a cafe.  Once you sit down
you determine that you need to start with a data set, and from that data set to
be able to create a function that can give you an open circuit voltage given a
battery state of charge.  You head back, and build the following <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ocv_soc.csv</span></code>

</a>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>After <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/aleph2c/miros/blob/master/examples/battery_model.py">completing the work</a> you
track down your electrical engineer and say, “Hey I have a battery simulator, do
you want to see it?”</p>
<p><span class="new-spec">Sure</span>.</p>
<p>“I wrote everything onto a picture before I wrote the code, then I went back and
forth between my picture and the code until I got it working, here is what I
have so far:”</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="_static/battery_model_3.pdf"><div align="center" class="align-center"><img alt="_images/battery_model_3.svg" src="_images/battery_model_3.svg" /></div>
</a>
<p><span class="new-spec">Another statechart eh?</span></p>
<p>“Yes, shall we start from the top?”  Not waiting for his answer you begin.</p>
<p>“Like before, the top of the diagram describes data and some methods and the
bottom part of the diagram describes the behavior of the software.”</p>
<p>“I have written two methods, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">_amp_given_terminal_volts</span></code> and
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">_amp_hours_given_amps</span></code> at the top of the diagram, near the simple circuit
drawing so I can see them near that picture.”</p>
<p>He reads these methods, and nods, then his eyes shift to the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">BatteryAttributes</span></code> class and asks, <span class="new-spec">What are the BatteryAttributes
and why aren’t they just in the Battery?</span>.</p>
<p>“I pulled those out into their own class, because I want to read and write
those attributes from more than one thread. The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">BatteryAttributes</span></code> class
inherits from the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ThreadSafeAttributes</span></code> class so it can access thread safe
features.  Then I pulled the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">BatteryAttributes</span></code> code into the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Battery</span></code>
class using the multiple inheritance feature of Python (which is just kind of
like a copy and paste).  Since they are in their own box on the diagram, with a
glance I can see what attributes are thread safe and what aren’t.”</p>
<p><span class="new-spec">How does the circuit work with your software?</span></p>
<p>“It describes the relationship between the terminal volts, the battery current
and the open_circuit_volts.  The open_circuit_volts has a relationship with the
state_of_charge of the battery, so from this simple circuit and the function
derived from the battery_profile_csv data, you can build the full simulator.
You can charge and discharge a simulated battery.”</p>
<p><span class="new-spec">How can you do that from this?</span> and points to the picture.</p>
<p>“I wanted the model to be ‘generalizeable’, as you say.  So, its based on
data that you feed it via the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">battery_profile.csv</span></code>.  Which is a simple spread
sheet describing the battery’s state_of_charge vrs the open_circuit_volts. Here
is a graph of that data:”</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="_static/battery_profile.pdf"><div align="center" class="align-center"><img alt="_images/battery_profile.svg" src="_images/battery_profile.svg" /></div>
</a>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">You can find the data to generate this model <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/aleph2c/miros/blob/master/examples/soc_ocv.csv">here</a>, and the
code to make the graphs <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/aleph2c/miros/blob/master/examples/soc_ocv.py">here</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>He looks at it and says, <span class="new-spec">Where did you get your data?</span>.</p>
<p>“<a class="reference external" href="https://www.cadex.com/en">Cadex</a> posts a lot of their information online.  I
used one of their pictures as a reference. My CSV file isn’t real though, I just
eyeballed their graph to make mine.”</p>
<p>He says, <span class="new-spec">Good enough, what is the second graph?</span></p>
<p>“The software can’t use the CSV file directly, it needs a function, so I build a
function from this data and this function was used to draw the second graph.”</p>
<p><span class="new-spec">So the second graph isn’t the data?  Not bad, it looks the same
as the CSV file.</span></p>
<p>“It took me a while to find something that would work, at first I tried to match
the data with a polynomial but it was very wiggly, I had something that looked
alright at order 8 but at order 9 it was starting to over-fit.  In the end I
just went with an interpolation provided by <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">scipy.interpolate</span></code>.  I think its
called a linear spline or something.  The point is that from the data I can
build a function.  From this function I can get the open_circuit_voltage given a
battery state_of_charge.”</p>
<p>“You can see that I build this function when the statechart enters the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">build_ocv_soc_profile</span></code>.” as I point to the statechart.</p>
<p>He asks, <span class="new-spec">Why did you put that in the statechart and not just in the
constructor of your python Battery class?</span></p>
<p>“I wanted to be able to switch graphs. If we decide to make the battery more
sophisticated we will have to do something like that;  when I was researching
how this relationship works I saw that the graph profile changes based on
charge-current, temperature and so on.  If I leave the function construction in
the statechart I can hot-swap it based on what is happening in the battery.”</p>
<p><span class="new-spec">I don’t think we will need something that sophisticated.  How does
the behavior work anyway?</span></p>
<p>“I wanted something that would look like how it looks when you are using a real
battery, so I made it’s time our time.  <span class="new-spec">What do you mean by that?</span></p>
<p>“You can feed the statechart <cite>amp</cite> or <cite>volt</cite> once it has started, and the
simulator will just assume that is what you are doing until you send it another
sample.  It’s like you are feeding it DC Amps or Volts until you send it new
information.  So, if we build a 100 Amp Hour battery, it will take in the order
of an hour to charge the battery at 100 Amps while we run it.”  <span class="new-spec">So it
literally acts like a battery in real time?</span></p>
<p>“Yeah, but I also wanted the option of compressing time, so that I don’t have to
sit around while I’m testing the software.  I’ll use the battery in our time
frame, to build data sets which can be run almost instantaneously later.”</p>
<p><span class="new-spec">Ok, how does that work, pull up the design and show me.</span></p>

<p>“Here we would have a battery that’s rated at 100 Amp hours, with an internal
resistance of 0.014 Ohms that is 10 percent full.  I already showed you the
state_of_charge versus open_circuit_voltage graph which will be used.”</p>
<p>“When the chart starts, it builds a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">fn_soc_to_ocv</span></code> which we already talked
about, then climbs into the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">update_charge_state</span></code> and waits for events.  From
here you can sent it <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">amp_hours</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">amps</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">amps_and_time</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">volts</span></code> or
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">volts_and_time</span></code> events.  Any one of these events can change the battery state.”</p>
<p>“Suppose we wanted to control the battery in constant voltage mode.  We would
send it a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">volts</span></code> event containing a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Volts</span></code> payload.  The code would look like
this:”</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">battery</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">send_fifo</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Event</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">signal</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">signal</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">volts</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">payload</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">Volts</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mf">11.7</span><span class="p">)))</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>“This event would be caught by the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">volts</span></code> hook in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">volts_to_amps</span></code> state
and it would be turned into a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">volts_and_time</span></code>.”</p>
<p><span class="new-spec">What is that time relative to?</span></p>
<p>“When the battery is started, the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">last_sample_time</span></code> is stored, so it will be
relative to that.”</p>
<p>You pause, he nods.</p>
<p>So you continue, “There is a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">volts_and_time</span></code> event, which is captured by the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">volts_to_amps</span></code> state, which calculates the amps based on the current state of
charge and the terminal volts.  The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">last_terminal_voltage</span></code> is squirreled
away, and then a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">amps_and_time</span></code> event is invented and posted to the chart.
Following that, a transition is made into the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">amps_to_amp_hours</span></code> state.”</p>
<p>“The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">amps_to_amps_hours</span></code> state, catches this <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">amps_to_time</span></code> event, and
figures out the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">terminal_voltage</span></code> again and calculates the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">amp_hours</span></code> being
produced by this sample of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">amps</span></code>.</p>
<p>You pause for a breath then say, “The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">amps_to_time</span></code> signal handler squirrels
away the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">last_current_amps</span></code>, the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">last_sample_time</span></code>, and the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">last_terminal_volts</span></code> and then it invents the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Amp_Hours</span></code> event and posts it
to the chart. Finally, it transitions to the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">update_charge_state</span></code>.</p>
<p>You wait for him to make eye contact, he studies the chart and without looking
at you says, <span class="new-spec">Keep going.</span></p>
<p>This <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">update_charge_state</span></code> receives the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">amp_hours</span></code> event, calculates the
new total amp hours for the battery, figures out a new state of charge, then
figures out what the new open circuit voltage is.  These values are thread-safe
so they can be read from within the statechart’s thread, or from any other
object that has a reference to the battery (like main).</p>
<p>“So, from our original volt event, we have a new battery state”.</p>
<p><span class="new-spec">Why is it so complicated?  Why not just update the battery information
directly from the terminal voltage using the battery circuit equations?</span></p>
<p>“It’s not that complicated, because it forces re-use of the same calculation
pathways.  The exact same logic will be followed if a constant current is
applied, but instead of the amps being calculated from the volts, they are
provided directly from the event.  Look, you can see something very similar
happens if an <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">amps</span></code> event is sent.”  You point to the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">amps_to_amp_hours</span></code>
state on the diagram. “Try and describe to me how it works.”</p>
<p>He looks at it and asks, <span class="new-spec">Where is the state machine usually
sitting?</span>  “It’s usually in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">update_charge_state</span></code>”.</p>
<p>He concentrates for a moment and says, <span class="new-spec">Yeah, ok, the amps event kind
of works the same way, it generates a amps_and_time event, which is caught then
fed as a amp_hours event, and eventually the chart climbs back into the
update_charge_state, like before.</span></p>
<p>He pauses, then says, <span class="new-spec">I think I see a problem though, what happens if an amps
event is being processed while the volts event was being processed?</span></p>
<p>“It’s not a problem because the invented signals are posted using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">post_lifo</span></code>
calls.  This will automatically change the order of the events in the queue, if
an <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">amp</span></code> event is received by the battery while it is still chewing on the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">volts</span></code> event, the invented <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">amps_and_time</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">amp_hours</span></code> events will be
invented an processed before the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">amps</span></code> event is dealt with. The call to
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">post_lifo</span></code> is very selfish; It will always push itself to the front of the
queue.”</p>
<p><span class="new-spec">Ok, so I think I kind of understand your design, let’s see it work.</span></p>
<p>“It’s kind of boring to watch, what do you want to see?”</p>
<p><span class="new-spec">Well, let’s watch the point at which the charger should switch
between bulk to absorption.  Ideally I would like to see this happen when the
battery is 80 percent charged.</span></p>
<p>“Ok, so I’ll place the battery near an 80 percent state of charge and transition
from a constant current to a constant voltage technique once it’s charged to 80
percent. What charge current do you want?”</p>
<p><span class="new-spec">What is the battery rating?</span>  You say, “100 Ah.”</p>
<p><span class="new-spec">Charge it at c/3, or about 30 amps</span>.</p>

batteries, the internal resistance changes as you charge the battery.  Would it
be hard for you to add another curve?  The battery resistence changes with its
state of charge.  If you add this your simulator will behave more like a real
battery.</span></p>
<p>“No, it wouldn’t be that hard, I would just do what I did before, the hardest
part would be finding good data and updating the diagram with a graphic.”</p>
<p><span class="new-spec">If it isn’t a big deal add it.  Otherwise, this is good enough.</span></p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Being a sucker for a challenge, you head back to the <a class="reference external" href="https://batteryuniversity.com/learn/archive/how_does_internal_resistance_affect_performance">cadex website</a>
and find a open circuit voltage versus internal resistance graph for a lead acid
battery:</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="_static/battery_resistance_profile.pdf"><div align="center" class="align-center"><img alt="_images/battery_resistance_profile.svg" src="_images/battery_resistance_profile.svg" /></div>
</a>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Above 14 V, the battery resistence was just made up.  This data was not
provided by cadex, I am just imagining how it would work.</p>
<p class="last">You can find the data to generate this model <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/aleph2c/miros/blob/master/examples/ocv_internal_resistance.csv">here</a>, and the
code to make the graphs <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/aleph2c/miros/blob/master/examples/ocv_internal_resistance.py">here</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>Then you update the battery simulator design:</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="_static/battery_model_4.pdf"><div align="center" class="align-center"><img alt="_images/battery_model_4.svg" src="_images/battery_model_4.svg" /></div>
</a>
<p><span class="new-spec">You know, if you keep adding features like this to the battery
simulator you are going to have something that is very useful, not just for us.</span></p>
<p>“All I need is data, its <cite>numpy</cite> and <cite>scipy</cite> that does the heavy lifting and the
statechart manages the time and the design complexity.  Speaking of which, I
have simplified things by adding the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">amps_into_terminal</span></code> and
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">volts_across_terminal</span></code> methods.  You shouldn’t have to know about event names
if you are using the simulator, the code should figure that out for you.</p>
<p><span class="new-spec">Can you speed it up? Maybe compress time? Like, make an
hour of charging in the battery’s time happen in tens of seconds in our time
frame?</span></p>
<p>“Yes, I added a time_series static function to the battery model, here is how we
would speed things up:”</p>

<p>“This code will get us around our Python time-slippage issue.  See how I
pre-calculate the time in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">time_series</span></code>?”</p>
<p><span class="new-spec">Not really.</span></p>
<p>“The call to the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">time_series</span></code> function basically creates a set
of time stamps ranging from “now” till one hour from now, 1 second apart.  There
will be 3600 of them.  We then try to slam the battery with data as fast as main
will run.  The battery model doesn’t know that its running one hour into our
future; we feed it its time reference.”</p>

</center><p><span class="new-spec">It looks good, but why does your simulator only run to 3581 and not
closer to 3600?</span></p>
<p>“I didn’t see that.”</p>
<p>You think for a moment and say, “It’s losing events, the main program is running
faster than the battery model’s thread.  If you added a small time delay at the
end of the loop the battery would be able to keep up.  Main is basically doing a
denial of service attack on the battery.  Despite this, the simulator seems to
work as you would expect.”</p>
<p><span class="new-spec">That’s kind of cool, but your tests will be non-deterministic.</span></p>
<p>“Yeah, I’ll add a delay when we use the simulator to test the charger.  You have
identified a bigger issue than the time-slippage issue, but it is much easier to
fix.”</p>

<p>Now that we have a way to simulate a battery, we will add this information to
our specification:</p>

<h2>Single Unit Three Stage Battery Charger Design (3)<a class="headerlink" href="#single-unit-three-stage-battery-charger-design-3" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>High level Specification (6)</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>This product will be a three stage charger with an equalization feature.</li>
<li>The charger has two control systems: constant current and constant voltage.</li>
<li>The bulk stage is a constant current control technique.</li>

<p><strong>Sofware Functional Specification (6)</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The software system will be broken into two parts, fast running c code and slower running Python code.</li>
<li>The c code will run in ISRs at a frequency of 20 Khz and will control the charger in either a constant current or
constant voltage mode. (see separate doc)</li>
<li>The Python code will determine which control strategy the c code is
using, it will also set the c code’s control system parameters.  The Python code will not directly control the electrical output of the unit</li>
<li>The Python code will sample the current and voltage and make decisions every 0.5 seconds</li>

<p><strong>Software Testing Specification (6)</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The charger’s data/behavioral software will be adjusted to use data instead of real electrical readings.</li>
<li>The software that will be shipped (production code) should be
identical to the software that is being tested.  The software testing code
should pass data into the production code and observe the production code’s
behavior without the production code knowing it is under test.</li>
<li>A simple physics model will be developed to describe the
relationship between the battery and the charger.  The testing code will use
this model to confirm that the charger’s behavioral software is working as
designed.  The physics model should be parameterized so that it can test
different battery types.</li>
