ENTRY_SIGNAL event should be sent to a state method when it’s boundary is

will be sent to a state method anytime a state has been settled upon.  An
EXIT_SIGNAL event should be sent to a state method when it’s boundary is

<dt id="term-orthogonal-region">Orthogonal Region</dt>
<dd><p class="first">A concept taken from the original Harel paper.  To understand what is meant
by an orthogonal region imagine two statecharts sitting beside one
another with a bunch of arrows between them. Loosely speaking if your to
draw a circle around these two statecharts and their arrows, you would be
describing two orthogonal regions. The word ‘orthogonal’ comes from
geometry where it describes a right angle. In the context of physics
‘orthogonal’ builds on this right angle idea and it adds the meaning that
two things do not effect each other that much.</p>
<p>The problem with orthogonal regions is one of search expense. If you are
sitting deep within one region and your statechart receives and event which
should take it deep within the other region, it must first search the chart
structure to find where it needs to go. The underlying framework within the
library does this work before it actually starts the exit and entry processing.</p>
<p>Given that you might be in the inner state of one of your orthogonal regions,
and you will need to search all the way out of this statechart and reach into
another; you are wasting cycles and adding a lot of computational complexity to
your design. This search is handled by the miros package, but your code will
run a lot slower than it needs to.</p>

<dt id="term-run-to-completion">Run To Completion</dt>
<dd>A run to completion process begins when a statechart receives an event.
It searches it’s local graph and makes a determination if it needs to
respond, if so it will transition from the local state to the target
state while adhering to the <a class="reference internal" href="#term-harel-formalism"><span class="xref std std-term">Harel Formalism</span></a>,
then it will run the INIT_SIGNAL within that target state.  If that state
initiations itself by transitioning to another state, the event processor
will run that transition with the <a class="reference internal" href="#term-harel-formalism"><span class="xref std std-term">Harel Formalism</span></a>.  This will continue until the <a class="reference internal" href="#term-statechart"><span class="xref std std-term">statechart</span></a>
has nothing left to do at which point it is finished it’s
run-to-completion processing.  The active objects can not be pre-empted

<dd>A signal is a common set of enumerations that apply to all sets of

events into pools of commmon meaning that can be used by your state

define as a user) and internal signals like INIT_SIGNAL, ENTRY_SIGNAL,
EXIT_SIGNAL .. which are used internally by the event processor
algorithm.</dd>
<dt id="term-spy">Spy</dt>
<dd>The spy is one of the two instrumentation techniques used by the miros

log live as it is running by using the live spy.  Or you can look to see

<dd>Yet Another Markup Language.  This is a plain text file with the
extension yml or yaml.  It was constructed as a reaction against XML.
XML was too difficult to read and format, so YAML was invented to make
configurations easy to read and edit.  (YAML files are largely hated by
MINECRAFT admistrators.)</dd>
