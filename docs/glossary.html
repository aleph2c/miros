<dt id="term-active-fabric">Active Fabric</dt>
<dd>A singleton class shared by all active objects.  Through it active
objects can publish and subscribe to events created by other active
objects.  It contains two seperate threads (fifo/lifo) each tied to their own
priority queue.  When an active object publishes to the active fabric, it
places the event in both priority queues at the priorty set as an
argument given to the publish call.  If another active object has
subscribed to that event with the fifo subscription, the active fabric
will post the event into it’s deque using the post_fifo method.  If it
subscribed using a lifo subscription it will post into it’s deque using
the post_lifo method.</dd>
<dt id="term-active-object">Active Object</dt>
<dd>Contains an event processor, a queue and a thread which wakes up when an
event is placed in its queue.  Upon waking, it calls the event processor with
the event and the state methods which are connected to the method are run
in accordance to the Harel Formalism.  An active object also has a
relationship with the Active Fabric, which is a singleton class shared by all
active objects.  If the Active Fabric has not been created before it is
created by the active object.  The active fabric is the software which
allows all active objects to communicate with all other active objects.</dd>
<dt id="term-artificial-event">Artificial Event</dt>
<dd>An artificial event is an event which is made within your active object
and posted to itself.  An example of an artificial event would be a
<a class="reference internal" href="#term-one-shot"><span class="xref std std-term">one shot</span></a>.  It is called <cite>artificial</cite> because it is not
an event that came from outside of the active object in an asynchronous
way.</dd>
<dt id="term-catch-and-release">Catch and Release</dt>
<dd>Describes a pattern where an event is caught by a state method, used as
stimulation to run client code and then re-released as if that state
didn’t know how to process the event.</dd>
<dt id="term-child-state">Child State</dt>
<dd>A child state is a relative term. For a state to be a child state of
another state it must be within that other state’s boundary.</dd>
<dt id="term-client-code">Client Code</dt>
<dd>Any code that you anchor onto your statechart.  It’s the code that
actually solves your business problem.  It is different the the
statechart code in that it does not describe the structure of the
hierarchical state machine.</dd>
<dt id="term-defer">Defer</dt>
<dd><p class="first">The <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">defer</span></code> method is a way to place an event into a secondary queue
that is ignored by the active object until the momenent the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">recall</span></code>
method is called.  At this point the event is placed into the active
object’s queue as if an outside caller used it’s <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">post_fifo</span></code> method.</p>
<p class="last">The number of elements contained with the deferred queue can be seen
using the spy instrumentation.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-event">Event</dt>
<dd><p class="first">Any action in the world that your program cares about.  It can be
triggered by a user, an instrument or internally by your own design.
Your program will notice, then react to this event by running a subset of
your design to manifest the behavior described by the chart’s structure.  An
event is often named something.  This name is called a signal.  An event
can also carry a payload, which can be any data object describable by
Python.</p>
<p class="last">An event can be source from a <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">post_fifo</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">post_lifo</span></code> or
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">publish</span></code> call.  An event can have an optional payload but it must be
created with a signal.  An event is always the second argument of your
state methods.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-event-processor">Event Processor</dt>
<dd>The event processor is the code the creates the Harel Formalism.  It was
ported from the work of Miro Samek.  The library is named miros in honour
of his contribution.</dd>
<dt id="term-factory">Factory</dt>
<dd>The Factory class inherits from the active object class and thereby gains
all of it’s abilities and relationship with the Active Fabric.  In
addition to this is can be used to manufacture state methods and nest
them within one another.  It also has a reflection feature, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">to_code</span></code>
which can be used to show what it’s manufactured state methods would look
like if they were hand crafted.</dd>
<dt id="term-fifo">Fifo</dt>
<dd>First in first out.  Things line up as you image they should.</dd>
<dt id="term-fsm">FSM</dt>
<dd>Finite State Machine: a <a class="reference internal" href="#term-state-machine"><span class="xref std std-term">state machine</span></a> without hierarchy.</dd>
<dt id="term-harel-formalism">Harel Formalism</dt>
<dd>The Harel Formalism is a set of rules for describing how events should be
processed by active objects.  They describe when <a class="reference internal" href="#term-internal-event"><span class="xref std std-term">internal
events</span></a> should be send to state methods.  For instance an
ENTRY_SIGNAL event should be sent to a state method when it’s boundary is
breached from the outside to the inside of the state.  An INIT_SIGNAL
will be sent to a state method anytime a state has been settled upon.  An
EXIT_SIGNAL event should be sent to a state method when it’s boundary is
being breached from an inside-to-the-outside.  If a state doesn’t know
how to manage an event it is passed out to it’s outer state.  If no
states know how to manage a signal it is ignored by the state chart.</dd>
<dt id="term-hierarchical-state-machine">Hierarchical State Machine</dt>
<dd>HSM: a state machine where states can exit within other states.  An outer
state is called a parent state and an inner state is called a child state.
In an HSM all child states share the behavior of the parents states unless
this behavior is over-written by the designer.</dd>
<dt id="term-hsm">HSM</dt>
<dd>Hierarchical State Machine: a state machine where states can exit within
other states.  An outer state is called a parent state and an inner state
is called a child state.  In an HSM all child states share the behavior of
the parents states unless this behavior is over-written by the designer.</dd>
<dt id="term-initialization-event">Initialization Event</dt>
<dd>The initialization (init) event, is an <a class="reference internal" href="#term-internal-event"><span class="xref std std-term">internal event</span></a> with signal called INIT_SIGNAL.  It is injected into your state
method when the event processor has settled upon this state after either
starting within it or finishing a state transition from a called to
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">trans</span></code>.  In UML the init event looks like a big black dot and an arrow
and it can point to another state, or have some code written directly on
it.</dd>
<dt id="term-internal-event">Internal Event</dt>
<dd>An internal event is an event that is created by the event processor and
sent to your active object to manifest the <a class="reference internal" href="#term-harel-formalism"><span class="xref std std-term">Harel Formalism</span></a>.  It is different from other events in that you don’t have to
explicitly invent it when you are creating your design.</dd>
<dt id="term-lifo">Lifo</dt>
<dd>Last in first out.  An item gets to barge to the front of a line.</dd>
<dt id="term-mealy-state-machine">Mealy State Machine</dt>
<dd>A state machine which provides program output on the transition between
states.  Because of this, the path taken by the state machine become’s
its own unmanaged state.  To program using the Mealy style you would
write functions onto your state transitions.</dd>
<dt id="term-moore-state-machine">Moore State Machine</dt>
<dd>A state machine which provides program output within the state.  This is
different from the Mealy approach, in that the transitions do not output
information from the program.  The program outputs happen within the
states themselves.</dd>
<dt id="term-multi-shot">Multi Shot</dt>
<dd>A multi shot is sent from a <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">post_lifo</span></code> call by setting the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">times</span></code>
argument to how every many events you would like to post (0 for
infinite).  If you would like to delay the event, set the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">deferred</span></code>
argument to True.  The <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">period</span></code> argument is in units of seconds and
it’s value will determine the time delay prior to the event being
presented to the active object’s queue if you have deferred the event.
It also represents the period of your multishot.</dd>
<dt id="term-one-shot">One Shot</dt>
<dd><p class="first">A one shot is a delay event.  It can be created using the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">post_fifo</span></code>
or <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">post_lifo</span></code> call by setting the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">times</span></code> argument to 1 and the
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">deferred</span></code> argument to True.  The <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">period</span></code> argument is in units of
seconds and it’s value will determine the time delay prior to the event
being presented to the active object’s queue.</p>
<p class="last">A one shot is often used as a kind of delayed <a class="reference internal" href="#term-initialization-event"><span class="xref std std-term">init</span></a>
event.  If your statechart needs to settle for a while before it
continues to the next state consider using a one shot.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-orthogonal-region">Orthogonal Region</dt>
<dd><p class="first">A concept taken from the original Harel paper.  To understand what is meant
by an orthogonal region imagine two statecharts sitting beside one
another with a bunch of arrows between them. Loosely speaking if your to
draw a circle around these two statecharts and their arrows, you would be
describing two orthogonal regions. The word ‘orthogonal’ comes from
geometry where it describes a right angle. In the context of physics
‘orthogonal’ builds on this right angle idea and it adds the meaning that
two things do not effect each other that much.</p>
<p>The problem with orthogonal regions is one of search expense. If you are
sitting deep within one region and your statechart receives and event which
should take it deep within the other region, it must first search the chart
structure to find where it needs to go. The underlying framework within the
library does this work before it actually starts the exit and entry processing.</p>
<p class="last">Given that you might be in the inner state of one of your orthogonal regions,
and you will need to search all the way out of this statechart and reach into
another; you are wasting cycles and adding a lot of computational complexity to
your design. This search is handled by the miros package, but your code will
run a lot slower than it needs to.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-parent-state">Parent State</dt>
<dd>A parent state is a relative term.  For a state to have a parent state it
must be incircled by that parent state in a Hierarchical State Machine.</dd>
<dt id="term-pattern">Pattern</dt>
<dd><p class="first">A statechart pattern is an example of how to structure a map with some of
the features provided by this library to solve a class of problems.</p>
<p class="last">The idea of a pattern was originally invented by the architect
Christopher Alexander.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-payload">Payload</dt>
<dd>A data object that has been injected into an Event.  It is intended to be
used by the consumer of the event.</dd>
<dt id="term-pseudostate">Pseudostate</dt>
<dd>Awkward language describing icons that aren’t transitions or states in a
statechart diagram.</dd>
<dt id="term-publish">Publish</dt>
<dd>An active object can publish an event anytime by using the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">publish</span></code>
method.  This will pass the event to the active fabric which will search
and determine if any other active objects have subscribed to the event.
If they have it will post this event into their internal queue so that it
will be consumed during a future run-to-completion process.</dd>
<dt id="term-recall">Recall</dt>
<dd>The <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">recall</span></code> method is to pop the oldest item from the deferred queue
and place those items into the working queue of the current active
object.</dd>
<dt id="term-rtc">RTC</dt>
<dd><a class="reference internal" href="#term-run-to-completion"><span class="xref std std-term">Run To Completion</span></a></dd>
<dt id="term-run-to-completion">Run To Completion</dt>
<dd>A run to completion process begins when a statechart receives an event.
It searches it’s local graph and makes a determination if it needs to
respond, if so it will transition from the local state to the target
state while adhering to the <a class="reference internal" href="#term-harel-formalism"><span class="xref std std-term">Harel Formalism</span></a>,
then it will run the INIT_SIGNAL within that target state.  If that state
initiations itself by transitioning to another state, the event processor
will run that transition with the <a class="reference internal" href="#term-harel-formalism"><span class="xref std std-term">Harel Formalism</span></a>.  This will continue until the statechart has nothing left to
do at which point it is finished it’s run-to-completion processing.  The
active objects can not be pre-empted with new events while they are in
the throes of running through a RTC process.  If an event is received it
is placed in the queue and it will not be considered by the event
processor until it’s RTC step is completed.</dd>
<dt id="term-sequence">Sequence</dt>
<dd>Sequence is a tool that consumes trace log strings and produces ASCII
sequence diagrams.  If the spy log contains the output of many different
active objects, the sequence tool will create as many sequence diagrams
as there are active objects in the trace.</dd>
<dt id="term-signal">Signal</dt>
<dd>A signal is a common set of enumerations that apply to all sets of events
within the system.  They are used to catagorize events into pools of
commmon meaning that can be used by your state methods to take action
upon.  There are external signals (which you define as a user) and
internal signals like INIT_SIGNAL, ENTRY_SIGNAL, EXIT_SIGNAL .. which are
used internally by the event processor algorithm.</dd>
<dt id="term-spy">Spy</dt>
<dd>The spy is one of the two instrumentation techniques used by the miros
library.  It shows every detail that the event processor is doing while
it is searching and running an RTC event.  You can add information into
the spy log by using the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">scribble</span></code> method.  You can view this
log live as it is running by using the live spy.  Or you can look to see
what the log contains by running the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">spy</span></code> method.  The spy log has a
ring buffer containing 500 spots.</dd>
<dt id="term-state">State</dt>
<dd>Defines the current operating condition of a program.  A program will have
more than one state and collectively these states are called a state machine.</dd>
<dt id="term-state-machine">State Machine</dt>
<dd>A program which uses <a class="reference internal" href="#term-state"><span class="xref std std-term">states</span></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="#term-event"><span class="xref std std-term">events</span></a> to
determine how it should react to information coming to it in an
asynchronous manner.</dd>
<dt id="term-state-method">State Method</dt>
<dd>The code used to describe a <a class="reference internal" href="#term-state"><span class="xref std std-term">state</span></a>.  They can be hand coded,
built using a template or described within a Factory.</dd>
<dt id="term-statechart">Statechart</dt>
<dd>A statechart is a Hierarchical State Machine with it’s own queue for the
events it hasn’t reacted against yet and a thread in which it can run.
The word was invented by David Harel and it is often used as a synonym
for active object or factory in this documentation.</dd>
<dt id="term-subscribe">Subscribe</dt>
<dd>A subscription is a multi-statchart concept.  When an active object would
like to receive and respond to a message provided by another active
object it can subscribe to the signal that that event will contain.</dd>
<dt id="term-substate">Substate</dt>
<dd>A child state.</dd>
<dt id="term-superstate">Superstate</dt>
<dd>A parent state.</dd>
<dt id="term-template">Template</dt>
<dd><p class="first">A template is a state method that has a structure which contains the
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">signal_callback</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">parent_callback</span></code> context managers.  You can
use a template using the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">state_method_template</span></code> and it will return a
state method who’s name is as an input.  It will be instrumented and will
has access to the signal callbacks and parent state which you provide
it’s active object with once it is formed.</p>
<p class="last">A state method built up this way can be turned back into a flat method by
using the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">to_code</span></code> method.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-top-state">Top State</dt>
<dd>A top state is a state that is the parent state to all states within a
Hierarchical state machine.  It actually exists as a state method within
the event processor.</dd>
<dt id="term-trace">Trace</dt>
<dd><p class="first">The trace is one of the two instrumentation techniques used by the miros
library.  It provides a high level view of what has happened, in that it
show the initial stimuleous, the starting state and the ending state per
line.  Unlike the spy it does not show the details related to how the
transitions occured or any of the internal workings of the event processor.</p>
<p>It can be used with the sequence tool to generate ASCII sequence
diagrams.</p>
<p class="last">You can view the live trace log by using the live trace.  Or you can look
to what what the log contains using the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">trace</span></code> method.  The trace log
has a ring buffer which contains 250 spots.</p>
