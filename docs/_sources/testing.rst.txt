  *"Why is it that you guys are so conservative in your views, in the face of
  the almost complete lack of understanding of what is going on in your field?"
  I asked.*
  
  *The answer was as simple as it was surprising.*
  
  *"If we [cosmologists] don't accept some common picture of the universe,
  however unsupported by the facts, there would be nothing to bind us together
  as a scientific community.  Since it is unlikely that any picture that we use
  will be falsified in our lifetime, one theory is as good as any other."*
  
  *The explanation was social, not scientific.*
  
  -- Per Bak, How Nature Works

  *The first principle is that you must not fool yourself â€” and you are the easiest person to fool.*
  
  -- Richard Feynman

  *You always start with a fantasy. Part of the fantasy technique is to
  visualize something as perfect. Then with the experiments you work back from
  the fantasy to reality, hacking away at the components.*

  -- Edwin H. Land
