The pattern on its shell is an example of a 1D cellular automata.  The shell is
grown by a kind of organic line of printer heads along the shell's lip.  These
printer heads, called pigment cells, can extrude colored calcium cement.  The
color choice of a pigment cell is dependent upon the color choice of it's two
adjacent pigment cells.  The rules governing this process are simple, yet a very
complex shell color pattern emerges.

A 1D cellular automata exists on a 2D grid of cells; like graphing paper, and it
is governed by a simple set of rules.  How you color in a square is dependent
upon the coloring of the three squares above it.  If we decided only to use
black and white coloring, a square's color would be dependent upon eight
different permutations of the three squares above it.  The governing rules of a
1D cellular automata could be described by drawing out these eight pictures.

But before we begin to fill in our drawings we would have to decide how to start
them.  Typically you color the middle square of the top line on your graphing
paper black, then begin painting the squares of the second line using the rules.
Of course, you don't have to do this, you can start however you like.  But how
you start is called the initial condition, and as you will see, the initial
conditions have a huge effect on the overall emergent pattern of your drawing.

In 1983 `Stephen Wolfram <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60P7717-XOQ>`_
discovered a 1D cellular automata which created patterns that look like the
shell of the Conus Textile snail.  He called this program, `Rule 30
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_30>`_.  

Let's explore how to make a Rule 30, 1D cellular automata, by looking at the
instructions which govern it:

   *"First, look at each cell and it's right-hand neighbor.  If both of these were
   white on the previous step, then take the new color of the cell to be whatever
   the previous color of its left-hand neighbor was.  Otherwise, take the new
   color to be the opposite of that."* [#]_

Here are these instructions as a picture:

.. image:: _static/rule_30_rule_in_pictures.svg
    :target: _static/rule_30_rule_in_pictures.pdf
    :align: center

.. note::

  If you look carefully at the picture version of the rule, you will see two
  rows of binary numbers, and the reason why rule 30 is called rule 30.

Now let's start a drawing: we will place a black square in the middle of the
first line then follow the rules to fill in the 4 lines below it.

.. image:: _static/rule_30_by_hand.svg
    :target: _static/rule_30_by_hand.pdf
    :align: center

If you look at the diagram and compare it to the rules described as a paragraph,
then to the pictures illustrating this same rule, you will see how it works.

Let's write some Python code that can build something like this.

But before we start, what do we do about the edges of our graphing paper?  We could just pretend
they aren't there, making the automata infinite.  Or, we could wrap the paper
into a tube so that there is no edge.  Both of these things have been done
before, but I haven't seen anyone just force a color onto the edge of the
graphing paper, like a wall.  So, let's do that, let's build a wall.

This will give us a chance to have two state machines interact in the same
cellular automata.  We need two different machines, a rule 30 machine and a wall
machine.  The wall machine should be able to be white or black.

Let's design a system, then build it and run it (not necessarily in that order)
and see if we can make something new.

High Level Sketches
-------------------

Before we start writing our code let's sketch out some pictures which will help
guide our thinking.  We would like to see:

* :ref:`a small example of the automata running inside of walls.<cellular_automata-a-small-example-of-the-automata-running-inside-of-walls>`
* :ref:`a general idea about how to get visual feedback from our code and how that
  will relate to our automata.<cellular_automata-a-highlevel-diagram>` (we will figure out the specifics later)
* :ref:`some drawings of the state machines needed to make the automata.<cellular_automata-state-machines-needed-to-build-automata>`

Automata Running Inside of Walls
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Here is a small example of the rule 30 automata running inside of walls:

.. image:: _static/rule_30_basic_design_0.svg
    :target: _static/rule_30_basic_design_0.pdf
    :align: center

This sketch is a mock-up of the output we would like our code to create.  It also
shows the rules which govern how the picture is made, some terminology and some
examples about how some of the components could be build with Python.

The top of the diagram describes rule 30 in pictures and the main part of the
drawing shows an example of the one dimensional automata we want to build.

The one dimensional automata is made up of individual cells, which will be
governed by two different sets of rules.  A cell can be derived from either a
``Rule30`` class which is governed by the rules described at the top of the page
or a ``Wall`` class, which is given a color to start at and remains in that color
forever.  Once a cell is instantiated, it is started in the color we want it to
appear in on our drawing.  The walls of the diagram are colored orange so that
we can distinguish them from the bulk of the drawing which is made up of rule 30
cells.

We would like our code to be able to run for a programmable number of
``generations``.  A single generation is a row of the one dimensional automata.
The ``Next`` event, will be used to tell the code representing the diagram, to
build its next generation.

We would also like our code to be able to build any width of cells.

The ``Z`` object represents the 2D binary matrix which will describe our
drawing.  This matrix will be used to analyze our automata as it runs.

High Level Design Diagram
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now that we know what kind of output we want, we need to think about how we will
structure a program to give us this output.

We need something that can make our one dimensional cellular automata and we
need some way to look at it.  Let's call the thing that we will use to visualize
our automata, a canvas.

Our canvas will be given an automata object which it will draw.  Our automata
object will have many rule 30 objects and many wall objects.

Here is what we wrote above, expressed as a UML diagram:

.. image:: _static/rule_30_basic_design_1.svg
    :target: _static/rule_30_basic_design_1.pdf
    :align: center

The ``Canvas`` class *has a* ``OneDCellularAutomata`` class.  This
``OneDCellularAutomata`` class *has many* ``Rule30`` and ``Wall`` classes.
Seems simple enough.

Let's build the ``Canvas`` class so that it can both draw our diagrams and make
video animations. Let's make the ``OneDCellularAutomata`` responsible for
creating any automata given a ``Wall`` class and a ``Rule`` class.

.. _cellular_automata-state-machines-needed-to-build-automata:

Statemachines Needed to Build Rule 30 in Walls
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We have drawn the ``Rule30`` and ``Wall`` classes as abstract blocks in the
previous high level diagram. But we know how they work, so let's re-draw them
now in more detail:

.. image:: _static/rule_30_basic_design_2.svg
    :target: _static/rule_30_basic_design_2.pdf
    :align: center

The state machine under the ``Rule30`` class will provide the behaviour
described by the squares at the top of the page.  The state machine under the
``Wall`` class consists of two states which can only be gotten to using the
``start_at`` method, no event will cause a transition between these states.  The
``Wall`` objects are intended to interface with the ``Rule30`` objects so that a
``Rule30`` cell can't tell if it is working with an actual machine or just a
wall.

.. _cellular_automata-design-and-code:

Design and Code
---------------
Now that we know what we want to build, let's make our designs more detailed and
write the Python code required to make the design work.

.. _cellular_automata-canvas:

Canvas Class
^^^^^^^^^^^^
The ``Canvas`` class will provide visual feedback.

But, how will we build a ``Canvas`` class to get the feedback needed to see what is
going on with our program?

If we were using Stephen Wolfram's Mathematica software, this work would be
trivial. Even if we were using Matlab, it wouldn't be too hard to see these
automata, but we are using Python so we will have to stitch a few things
together before we can visualize our work.

Let's go technology shopping.

A few years ago Python `borg'd <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyenRCJ_4Ww>`_
Matlab, into its ``numpy``, ``scipy`` and ``matplotlib`` packages, so the Matlab
type interfaces have been assimilated into the Python collective: resistance is
futile.  We can use the ``numpy`` and ``matplotlib`` libraries to get the Matlab
features we need to build and animate our automata.

The ``matplotlib`` library can animate graphs so we will use that.  The graphing
paper look that we want is provided by its ``matplotlib.pcolormesh`` graphing
object so we will use that too.  Animations are provided by the
``matplotlib.FuncAnimation`` class, which takes a reference to the figure you
are drawing on, information about how many frames you want in your movie and how
often you want to show them, and some callback functions that affect the data
(your picture) for each frame.  The callback functions will be very useful,
because it means we can pull the operation of our automata away from the
``Canvas`` class and we can make the animation callback call out to a Python
coroutine, so we can run our automata forever (if we wanted that).

Under the hood ``matplotlib`` calls out to ``FFmpeg``, which is some open source
software that makes videos.  Let's install what we need and get back to our
design:

.. code-block:: python

   sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
   pip install numpy
   pip install matplotlib

.. note::

  I'm assuming you are working within a virtual enviroment.  If you are on
  windows, go and get the ubuntu app, and run this code within your Windows
  Linux Subsystem (WLS).  If you are on a mac, you can use ``brew`` to get
  ffmpeg.

Here is a UML drawing of the Canvas class:

.. image:: _static/rule_30_canvas.svg
    :target: _static/rule_30_canvas.pdf
    :align: center

The ``Canvas`` class will have a ``FuncAnimation`` object and a
``LinearSegmentedColormap`` (used for making colors), and it shows us how we
want to make the object and how we want to use it with the ``run_animation`` and
``save`` methods.

It also shows us that the Canvas calls will have a ``OneDCellularAutomata``
object, which will be created elsewhere, then passed to it.

.. note::

  On construction: I didn't write the ``Canvas`` class out of thin air, I
  created a 2 dimensional array and some functions that would randomize this
  array, then I fed these functions into the code that I built up using examples
  from the internet until I got something working.  Only then did I feed it the
  OneDCellularAutomata class, which originally didn't use a co-routine; it
  was added later.

.. _cellular_automata-two2Automato:

The OneDCellularAutomata Class
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Let's give our basic design another look:

.. image:: _static/rule_30_basic_design.svg
    :target: _static/rule_30_basic_design.pdf
    :align: center

The ``OneDCellularAutomata`` object will be responsible for applying the rules
to our graphing paper, and for setting it into its initial condition (the black
square in the middle of the top line).

To do this ``OneDCellularAutomata`` will provide a two-dimensional array, Z,
containing color codes, to be used by our Canvas to draw things.  It also builds
a lot of ``Rule30`` and ``Wall`` state machines and links them to other machines
so that they can read the ``left.color`` and ``right.color`` attributes of their
adjacent cells.  ``OneDCellularAutomata`` needs to set up some initial
conditions; how the machines are started on the first line of our graphing
paper.  The ``Rule30`` state machines respond to ``Next`` events, which cause
them to react and change if they need to change, so the ``OneDCellularAutomata``
will need to dispatch this event into all of the ``Rule30`` objects to make a
new line as the automata propagate downward.

To make the ``OneDCellularAutomata`` object generic, we will feed it its
automata rule and wall rules as classes.  To make the wall behaviour
parameterizable, I'll add some new wall rule classes that hold the left and
right colors in their class attributes:

.. image:: _static/rule_30_basic_design_1.svg
    :target: _static/rule_30_basic_design_1.pdf
    :align: center

Here is a UML diagram of the ``OneDCellularAutomata`` class:

.. image:: _static/rule_30_twodcellularautomata.svg
    :target: _static/rule_30_twodcellularautomata.pdf
    :align: center

There is a bunch of stuff in this diagram that I don't know how to draw using
UML.  For instance, how do I show a class that I have sent it a class, so it
knows how to build something, using the class I just gave it?  How do I draw
something that makes a co-routine?

Well, I don't know, so I will just scribble down something that isn't too
confusing and explain what I meant here with a few words:

The few key takeaways from the drawing are how the constructor works, we feed it
in the rule and wall classes so that it can generically construct automata.  We
also show the function that returns the co-routine.  Each time ``next`` is
called it advances to the next yield statement.  So, the first time the
coroutine is activated, it will initialize the automata, and then every
activation after that will cause it to descend one row down.

  import numpy as np
  from miros import Event

.. _cellular_automata-rule30-and-the-walls:

Rule30 and the Wall Classes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``Rule30`` is a class which describes the attributes and methods needed by our
rule30 state machine.   The rule30 state machine really isn't described anywhere
as an individual entity, it is two callback functions that attach to a
``Rule30`` object.  You can see it here:

.. image:: _static/rule_30_basic_design_1.svg
    :target: _static/rule_30_basic_design_1.pdf
    :align: center

To see if the rule 30 machine is designed properly, put your eyes on one of the
clusters-of-four-squares at the top of the diagram.  Now imagine the state
machine was started in the color of the middle of the top three squares of this
cluster.  Send the ``Next`` event to the machine and see if you can get it to
transition to the color of the bottom square of the cluster.

Let's do the first one together:

.. image:: _static/rule_30_does_it_work.svg
    :target: _static/rule_30_does_it_work.pdf
    :align: center

If you repeat this exercise for each of the cluster-of-four-squares, and you are
satisfied, then this state machine's design will give us the rule 30 behavior.

The wall is an even simpler machine, it starts in one color state and remains
that way forever.

Here is the code for our ``Rule30`` and ``Wall`` classes:

Now that we have all the parts we need let's stitch them together and see what
happens.  We will build an automata using rule 30 with some white walls. Then we
will feed the automata into a canvas, and use the canvas to print a `png` file,
a `pdf` file and an `mp4` movie:

.. code-block:: python

   generations = 200

   automata = OneDCellularAutomata(
     generations=generations,
     machine_cls=Rule30,
     wall_cls=WallLeftWhiteRightWhite)

   ecosystem = Canvas(automata)
   ecosystem.run_animation(generations, interval=100)  # 100 ms
   eco.save('rule_30_white_walls_200_generations.mp4')
   eco.save('rule_30_white_walls_200_generations.pdf')
   eco.save('rule_30_white_walls_200_generations.png')

Here is the movie:

Let's try it with black walls

.. code-block:: python

   generations = 200

   automata = OneDCellularAutomata(
     generations=generations,
     machine_cls=Rule30,
     wall_cls=WallLeftBlackRightBlack)

   ecosystem = Canvas(automata)
   ecosystem.run_animation(generations, interval=50)  # 50 ms
   eco.save('rule_30_black_walls_200_generations.mp4')
   eco.save('rule_30_black_walls_200_generations.pdf')
   eco.save('rule_30_black_walls_200_generations.png')

Here is a `link <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSsddlg9o2M&feature=youtu.be>`_ to the resulting video, and below you can see what happens when we run 200 generations of rule 30 with black walls.

.. image:: _static/rule_30_black_walls_200_generations.png

`Running it again for 500 generations <https://youtu.be/r24NV8vQPKc>`_ and with white walls results in this:

    :target: _static/rule_30_white_walls_500_generations.pdf
    :align: center

On this diagram we can see order imposing itself from the left white wall, and a `kind of repeating pattern on the left side of the triangle <https://blog.stephenwolfram.com/data/uploads/2017/05/5.png>`_ which emerges from our initial conditions.  The center and right part of the results seem to be full of disorder.

.. note::

   On limitations:

   The pdf resulting from the 500 generation run of our automata is over 5 MB;
   this is a lot of data to add to your computer if you want to clone the miros
   library, so I will refrain from going bigger.

   It took a long time to render the 500 generation automata.  I don't know
   where the computational bottle-neck is coming from; if it were important to
   me I could profile the different parts of the code until I found my issue,
   but the issue could be Python itself.  Mathematica has no such obvious
   limitation. If you want to do a deep dive into this subject and don't have
   the resources to buy a Mathematica licence, you can buy a Raspberry Pi with
   the NOOBs OS, then VNC onto the device from your desktop.  Wolfram Alpha is
   being given away on this platform.


.. _cellular_automata-the-nothing:

The Nothing (n-phenomenon)
--------------------------

The white and black walls force order into the automata; causing a kind of
pattern crystallization to propagate across our results.  We lose the incredible
complexity of rule 30, to this ordering pattern, which I think of as the
`nothing <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-5QTdC7hOo>`_. Order imposes itself
like a prion does in the brain of someone with Alzheimer's.  We have seen that
this effect takes place with both white and black walls, the key is that there
is an inflexible minority on the walls, imposing itself on a flexible majority.
(Nassim Nicholas Taleb calls this kind of thing `a normalization
<https://medium.com/incerto/the-most-intolerant-wins-the-dictatorship-of-the-small-minority-3f1f83ce4e15>`_.)

I will call this destructive ordering, the n-phenomenon.

.. note::

  Our universe seems to have set rules (the laws of physics) but it will not run
  into this n-phenomenon, repetition issue; because it doesn't seem to be
  confined within walls or have limited memory: the universe is expanding at an
  accelerating rate.

  Maybe it would have been wiped out by an n-phenomenon if it weren't expanding.

Let's study it in a bit more detail.  I will shrink the width of our graphing
paper to 30 cells and watch the n-phenomenon completely destroy rule 30's beautiful
complexity over 100 generations.

.. code-block:: python
  :emphasize-lines: 7

   generations = 100

   automata = OneDCellularAutomata(
     generations=generations,
     machine_cls=Rule30,
     wall_cls=WallLeftWhiteRightWhite,
     cells_per_generation=30)

   ecosystem = Canvas(automata)
   ecosystem.run_animation(generations, interval=500)  # 500 ms
   eco.save('rule_30_white_walls_100_generations_width_30.mp4')

   </center>

It seems that the n-phenomenon has a pattern velocity; resulting in an angle.
My protractor tells me that the ordered crystallization, caused by the white
minority at the wall, spreads downward at an angle of about 20 degrees.

If we reduce the width of the graphing paper, this pattern seems to
advance quicker into the chaos:

.. code-block:: python
  :emphasize-lines: 7

   generations = 100

   automata = OneDCellularAutomata(
     generations=generations,
     machine_cls=Rule30,
     wall_cls=WallLeftWhiteRightWhite,
     cells_per_generation=15)

   ecosystem.run_animation(generations, interval=500)  # 500 ms
   eco.save('rule_30_white_walls_100_generations_width_30.mp4')

Compare the 30 cell width result to the 15 cell width result:

   </div>
   <div style="clear:both;"></div> 
   </center>

So the angle of the n-phenomenon does not necessarily shrink with a reduction in
the graphing paper's width.

Let's write some code that can calculate the angle of the n-phenomenon.

We will set the walls to be white and the initial condition is a single black
rule 30 machine, sandwiched between other rule 30 machines started in the white
state:

.. image:: _static/rule_30_twodcellularautomata_with_angle.svg
    :target: _static/rule_30_twodcellularautomata_with_angle.pdf
    :align: center

The blue object in the diagram represents the disordered part of a rule 30
simulation contained by white walls.  The cyan circle is the angle, in degrees, we are
searching for.

.. code-block:: python

  class OneDCellularAutomataWithAngleDiscovery(OneDCellularAutomata):

    def __init__(self, 
        generations, 
        cells_per_generation=None, 
        initial_condition_index=None,
        machine_cls=None,
        wall_cls=None):

      super().__init__(
        generations,
        cells_per_generation,
        initial_condition_index,
        machine_cls,
        wall_cls)

      self.black_mask = np.array([Black], dtype=np.float32)
      self.white_mask = np.array([White], dtype=np.float32)
      self.n_mask = np.concatenate(
         (self.white_mask, self.black_mask), axis=0)
      self.n_angle = 90

    def build_next_mask(self):
      if abs(self.n_mask[-1] - White) < 0.001:
        self.n_mask = np.concatenate(
          (self.n_mask, self.black_mask), axis=0)
      else:
        self.n_mask = np.concatenate(
          (self.n_mask, self.white_mask), axis=0)

    def update_angle(self):

      previous_generation = self.generation+1
      row_to_check = self.Z[previous_generation]
      sub_row_to_check = row_to_check[0:len(self.n_mask)]

      if np.array_equal(self.n_mask, sub_row_to_check):

        self.nothing_at_row = self.generations-previous_generation + 1
        adjacent = self.nothing_at_row - self.cells_per_generation / 2.0
        opposite = self.cells_per_generation
        self.n_angle = math.degrees(math.atan(opposite/adjacent))

        self.build_next_mask()

    def next_generation(self):
      super().next_generation()
      self.update_angle()

With this code we can plot how the angle of the n-phenomenon changes as a
function of the graphing paper width:

.. image:: _static/cells_per_generation_vrs_angle_of_n_phenomenon.svg
    :target: _static/cells_per_generation_vrs_angle_of_n_phenomenon.pdf
    :align: center

.. note::

  The angle is still an approximation, since as you will see shortly, the
  n-phenomenon is not a straight line.

Here is a video of 196 different renderings of rule thirty within white walls.
The video starts with 2 rule 30 machines squished between two white walls.
For each frame advance of the video, a cell is added to the width of the
graphing paper and the automata is restarted an run with a black machine
at the top and middle of the simulation.

.. raw:: html

   <center>
   <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8aHWeo_dgs0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
   </center>

The top part of the video remains constant as the width of the graphing paper
expands, which makes sense, since that part of the diagram experiences the same
set of initial conditions.  What is surprising is how avalanches perpetuate
through the diagram as the width of the graphing paper increases.  The left side
will cause an avalanche for two frames, then the right side will cause an
avalanche for two frames, then the left side again and so on and so forth.

You can see when the patterns are going to shift by watching for the "left white
_|" and the "black right L".  If either of these mini-patterns appear, it will
tell you that the avalanche on their side of the diagram is over, and to move
your eyes to the other side of the page for the next frame.

As tempting as it is to think that this 2 beat oscillation is a feature of the
automata, it probably isn't.  The 2 beat oscillation is the result of the
divide-by-2-and-round-the-result mixed with the
expansion-of-the-size-of-the-page.  Essentially we are changing the initial
conditions on one side of the page for 2 beats, then the other side for two
beats.  Because rule 30 creates a chaotic system that is highly sensitive to its
initial conditions we have avalanches of change in response to a new
partial-starting-state. The initial conditions remain the same for the top part
of the diagram, but are expressed when the rule 30 body hits the new wall
condition.

The video makes me think about time traveling stories.  If we imagine the new
starting condition as the location of a time traveler arriving in the past from
the future (to change one thing and then leave), we can see how he effects
history as the change-avalanche on his side of the video frame.  The entire past
isn't changed, just the side that was within the causal cone of his avalanche.

The rule 30 states only one square can be effected each generation; so the
maximum theoretical propagation of a historical distortion is 45 degrees.  In
our reality we also have such a causal limitation, it is the speed of light, c.

Random Number Generation
==========================

Let's try and build a random number generator using a simple Python program.

First we should discuss our constraints.  Rule 30 provides an interesting
chaotic phenomenon, we would like to use this rule versus another rule, or we
may accidentally lose our ability to generate chaos.  If we make our graphing
paper very wide, then we need more computer memory and more computing resources
to construct the next generation of automata.  If we use walls, then we have
order imposing itself back into the body of the chaos, as the n-phenomenon, over
only a few generations.  Even if we can perfectly manage this n-phenomenon,
there are only so many permutations that can be held within the bounds of our
rectangle, and if we repeat a pattern we are not generating a random number, but
rather a long periodic number; a pseudo-random number.

So there seems to be a theoretical upper bound to what we can generate using
limited memory given that the rule doesn't change and the state of the program
is held within a bounded rectangle. My first guess at what our upper bound is:
``2**n`` where ``n`` is the number of states within the rectangle, and the ``2``
is selected because we are only tracking two colors, black and white.

First things first, let's deal with the n-phenomenon coming from the walls.  We
have control of the walls, and we have a chaos generator, so let's mine the
chaos and feed it back into the walls.

.. image:: _static/rule_30_chaos_to_walls_1.svg
    :target: _static/rule_30_chaos_to_walls_1.pdf
    :align: center

We can write the colors of our center column into a deque, and use the top two
colors of this deque to set the color of the walls.  Let's call this deque the
``core_colors``.  To begin with we set all of the ``core_colors`` to white, so
that the walls will remain white for at least the first ``len(core_colors) - 2``
generations.  For every ``Next`` event, the ``core_colors`` deque is pushed one
spot downward into the center of our automata, where it is painted with the
color of the core at that spot.

We will use the last two elements of our ``core_colors`` to determine the color
of our walls.  These last two spots will act as a 2 digit binary number, holding
the values of ``WallLeftWhiteRightWhite``, ``WallLeftWhiteRightBlack``,
``WallLeftBlackRightWhite`` and ``WallLeftBlackRightBlack``.  How this rule is
applied isn't that important, it just has to consistently map the center's chaos
onto the walls.

So, how long do we make this ``core_colors`` deque?  My intuition is to feed it
as much chaos as rule 30 can generate, then feed this back into the automata
before the n-phenomenon destroys the disorder.  I predict that we will have a
very long unique pattern when the length of the center column's deque depth is
equal to the number of cells from the top to where the n-phenomenon eats away
the chaos.  I will mark this queue depth estimate with a ``*`` in my data.

.. note::

   You might be asking yourself, "Why don't we pull the chaos from its deepest
   well: the far right side of the bulk of the rule 30 cells in the body of our
   automata."  I was originally going to do this, until I saw the effect of the
   time traveler videos in the previous section.  The cone of causality
   propagates from the walls.  If we mine the chaos from the right side, there
   won't be a chance for the rule30 interactions on the right side to feel the
   effect of the bulk and as a result we will end up with a very narrow feedback
   loop despite having a deeper deque.  This theory could be tested and
   disproved, but my program is inefficient and my computer is very slow, so I
   took the center path.

The length of the unique pattern duration will be too much to measure manually,
so I will adjust the code to report the unique pattern duration for a specific
combination of cell width and queue depth.  I'll explain how I
did this after I present my data and results.

Let's start with the discovered data:

.. note::

   ``**`` means, that there is a kind of n-phenomenon pattern that emerges after some
   time, but before this occurs there is a a nice, richly chaotic pattern.

So, my prediction wasn't terrible.  It turns out that as far as guesses
go, if we set the ``core_color`` deque length to the number of cells from the
top of the automata to where the n-phenomenon would overtake the chaos (leaving
the walls white), then you get some decent periodicity.  However, we
consistently observed that just above my predicted optimal number, there is a
very large swell in the length of unique pattern duration.

Another strange thing was observed: the length of a unique pattern duration
increases as we increase the ``core_color`` deque length.  In some cases we seem
to be getting massive gains with tiny marginal increases in the ``core_color``
deque length.  Are we getting something from nothing?  No, it turns out you get
massive increases in the unique pattern duration but you don't have consistent
chaos in the pattern:  the chaos is marbled with the n-phenomenon.  You can see
this effect in this video of rule 30 within recursive walls, 12 cells wide, with
a ``core_color`` deque length of 40, run for 400 generations (settles into a
loop of 47 cells):

There are other incidence were a different repeating pattern emerges after a
long burst of rich chaos.  The repeating pattern is much more complex than the
n-phenomenon, but much less complex than its preceding chaos.

For width 22 we see something really cool.  The chaos just stops, there is no
repetition of a complex pattern, we get to see it once, then never again.  This
has a nice effect of hiding the pattern's duration from my autocorrelation
routine.  To measure the duration of the chaos burst I had to manually read it
from the picture, this was very time consuming.  For width 22, the
``core_color`` deque is often infected with the n-phenomenon despite our best
efforts to feed it's chaos into the walls.  Given that this phenomenon was
discovered within the first 12 tested rectangle widths, it is not unreasonable
to assume that is a common occurrence; there will probably be a lot of widths and
queue depth combinations that result in the ultimate destruction of the chaos
generator.  You can see
this effect in this video of rule 30 within recursive walls, 22 cells wide, with
a ``core_color`` deque length of 20, run for 400 generations (one unique pattern
for 357 cells):
