    Required for serialization prior to sending an event across an IO

    Due to the dynamic nature of the Event/signals object, an event object can
    not just be pickled.  Instead the object must be passed through this 'Event.dumps'
    function, then de-serialized using the 'Event.loads' function.

    The numbering parity of the signal is not guaranteed across a network, but,
    the signal name will be unique within all of the signals objects expressed on each
    machine.  This is because signals are constructed dynamically.  So if one
    machine defines the signal 'A' before 'B' and another just defines 'B'.  The
    internal signals numbers for 'B' will not be the same for each machine.
    This doesn't matter, since it is the signal name 'B' that distinguishes the
    signal within a statechart and each machine will have the 'B' signal defined
    once.

    This 'dumps' method pulls out the signal name and payload, creates a
    dictionary from them then turns it into a json object.   The signal number
    is ignored during the process.

    Example:
      json_event = Event.dumps(Event(signal=signals.Mary))

    method is for deserializing a serialized event object.  See the example for
    clarity.
